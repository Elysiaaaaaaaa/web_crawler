This is a re-upload of the aya_collection, and only differs in the structure of upload. While the original aya_collection is structured by folders split according to dataset name, this dataset is split by language. We recommend you use this version of the dataset if you are only interested in downloading all of the Aya collection for a single or smaller set of languages.
		Dataset Summary
	
The Aya Collection is a massive multilingual collection consisting of 513 million instances of prompts and completions covering a wide range of tasks.
This collection incorporates instruction-style templates from fluent speakers and applies them to a curated list of datasets, as well as translations of instruction-style datasets into 101 languages. Aya Dataset, a human-curated multilingual instruction and response dataset, is also part of this collection. See our paper for more details regarding the collection.

Aya Datasets Family:
Name
Explanation
aya_dataset
Human-annotated multilingual instruction finetuning dataset, comprising over 204K instances across 65 languages.
aya_collection
Created by applying instruction-style templates from fluent speakers to 44 datasets, including translations of 19 instruction-style datasets into 101 languages. This collection structured based on dataset level subsets. An alternative version of the collection structured by language subsets is also available.
aya_collection_language_split
Aya Collection structured based on language level subsets.
aya_evaluation_suite
A diverse evaluation set for multilingual open-ended generation, featuring 250 culturally grounded prompts in 7 languages, 200 translated prompts in 24 languages, and human-edited versions selected for cross-cultural relevance from English Dolly in 6 languages.
		Dataset
	
The Aya Collection is a comprehensive, large corpus of datasets that can be used by researchers around the world to train multilingual models. Our goal is only to include datasets with permissive licensing for manipulation and redistribution.
The Aya Collection consists of three different sources of data:
Templated data: We collaborated with fluent speakers to create templates that allowed for the automatic expansion of existing datasets into various languages.
Translated data: We translated a hand-selected subset of 19 datasets into 101 languages (114 dialects) using the NLLB 3.3B parameter machine translation model.
Aya Dataset: We release the Aya Dataset as a subset of the overall collection. This is the only dataset in the collection that is human-annotated in its entirety.
		Load with Datasets
	
To load this dataset with Datasets, you'll need to install Datasets as pip install datasets --upgrade and then use the following code:
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("CohereForAI/aya_collection_language_split", "english")
In the above code snippet, "english" refers to a subset of the aya_collection. You can load other subsets by specifying its name at the time of loading the dataset.
		Data Instances
	
An example of a train instance looks as follows:
{'id': 246001,
 'inputs': 'The following query in English is taken from the geography category. What could be the answer to the question?\nWhat is the seventh tallest mountain in North America?',
 'targets': 'The answer is Mount Lucania.',
 'dataset_name': 'Mintaka-inst',
 'sub_dataset_name': '-',
 'task_type': 'question-answering',
 'template_id': 3,
 'language': 'eng',
 'split': 'train',
 'script': 'Latn'
}
		Data Fields
	
The data fields are the same among all splits:
id: Unique id of the data point
inputs: Prompt or input to the language model.
targets: Completion or output of the language model.
dataset_name: The name of the source dataset that the data point was taken from
sub_dataset_name: If the source is a collection, this field indicates which part of that collection the data point was taken from. If it is not a collection, this field is left blank.
task_type: The task type that this conversation belongs to.
template_id: The id of the template applied to this data point.
language: The ISO code of the dialect of the conversation.  
script: The script of the language.
split: Indicates whether the data point is part of the train or the test split.

		Motivations & Intentions
	
Curation Rationale: Automatic augmentation of existing datasets serves to enhance the available linguistic resources for multiple languages. The list of languages was initially established from mT5 and aligned with the annotators’ language list and NLLB translation model. The datasets were translated directly from English for all languages.
		Additional Information
	
		Provenance
	
Methods Used: A combination of crowd-sourced templating and automatic translation was employed to source this dataset.
