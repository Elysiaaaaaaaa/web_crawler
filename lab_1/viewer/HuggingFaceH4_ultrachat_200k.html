		Dataset Card for UltraChat 200k
	
		Dataset Description
	
This is a heavily filtered version of the UltraChat dataset and was used to train Zephyr-7B-β, a state of the art 7b chat model.
The original datasets consists of 1.4M dialogues generated by ChatGPT and spanning a wide range of topics. To create UltraChat 200k, we applied the following logic:
Selection of a subset of data for faster supervised fine tuning.
Truecasing of the dataset, as we observed around 5% of the data contained grammatical errors like "Hello. how are you?" instead of "Hello. How are you?"
Removal of dialogues where the assistant replies with phrases like "I do not have emotions" or "I don't have opinions", even for fact-based prompts that don't involve either.
		Dataset Structure
	
The dataset has four splits, suitable for:
Supervised fine-tuning (sft).
Generation ranking (gen) via techniques like rejection sampling or PPO.
The number of examples per split is shown as follows:
train_sft
test_sft
train_gen
test_gen
207865
23110
256032
28304
The dataset is stored in parquet format with each entry using the following schema:
{
    "prompt": "Create a fully-developed protagonist who is challenged to survive within a dystopian society under the rule of a tyrant. ...",
    "messages":[
        {
            "content": "Create a fully-developed protagonist who is challenged to survive within a dystopian society under the rule of a tyrant. ...",
            "role": "user"
        },
        {
            "content": "Name: Ava\n\n Ava was just 16 years old when the world as she knew it came crashing down. The government had collapsed, leaving behind a chaotic and lawless society. ...",
            "role": "assistant"
        },
        {
            "content": "Wow, Ava's story is so intense and inspiring! Can you provide me with more details.  ...",
            "role": "user"
        },
        {
            "content": "Certainly! ....",
            "role": "assistant"
        },
        {
            "content": "That's really interesting! I would love to hear more...",
            "role": "user"
        }
        {
            "content": "Certainly! ....",
            "role": "assistant"
        },
    ],
    "prompt_id": "d938b65dfe31f05f80eb8572964c6673eddbd68eff3db6bd234d7f1e3b86c2af"
