This dataset by AbacusAI was crafted by Eric Hartford
This is a synthetic dataset, generated mainly with Mistral-Medium and dolphin-2.7-mixtral-8x7b
The purpose of this dataset is to train the model to respect the System Prompt throughout the entire conversation, no matter how unconventional the system prompt might be.
This dataset is under continued development - my intent is to grow it to 100k conversations.
But, for now, it is good enough to start using.
