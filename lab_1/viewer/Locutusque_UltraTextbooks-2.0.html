		Dataset Description
	
		Repository
	
The "UltraTextbooks v2" dataset is hosted on the Hugging Face platform.
		Purpose
	
The "UltraTextbooks v2" dataset is an expanded version of the original "UltraTextbooks" dataset, with a focus on increasing the diversity of content in the domains of machine learning, mathematics, and coding. It remains a comprehensive collection of high-quality synthetic and human-written textbooks designed for advanced natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, educational question answering, text summarization, and content generation for educational purposes.
		Data Sources
	
In addition to the data sources from the original dataset, "UltraTextbooks v2" incorporates the following datasets from the Hugging Face platform:
nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o (1.5 million samples)
vikp/textbook_quality_programming
Locutusque/prepared-automathtext
Hack90/libre_chem_textbooks
nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks (1 million samples)
MedRAG/textbooks
vikp/clean_notebooks_filtered
These additional sources significantly enhance the coverage of machine learning, mathematics, and coding topics within the dataset.
		Composition
	
		Size
	
With the inclusion of the new data sources, "UltraTextbooks v2" now contains an even more extensive collection of textbook pages and chapters. The dataset has actually shrunk to around 3,200,000 examples with about 6 gigabytes of data.
		Content Summary
	
In addition to the wide range of topics covered in the original dataset, "UltraTextbooks v2" places a stronger emphasis on machine learning, mathematics, and coding. The texts remain a blend of synthetic (AI-generated) and human-written material.
		Data Splits
	
As with the original dataset, "UltraTextbooks v2" is provided as a single training set. Users have the flexibility to create their own test and validation splits according to their specific requirements.
		Data Fields
	
The "UltraTextbooks v2" dataset contains the following data fields:
text - A passage from a textbook.
source - Contains the source dataset.
		Data Collection Process
	
		Data Collection
	
The additional data is sourced from the specified Hugging Face datasets, following the same rigorous selection process to ensure high quality and relevance for educational purposes, particularly in the domains of machine learning, mathematics, and coding.
