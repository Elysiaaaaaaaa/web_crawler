Explanation
aya_dataset
Human-annotated multilingual instruction finetuning dataset, comprising over 204K instances across 65 languages.
aya_collection
Created by applying instruction-style templates from fluent speakers to 44 datasets, including translations of 19 instruction-style datasets into 101 languages, providing 513M instances for various tasks.
aya_evaluation_suite
A diverse evaluation set for multilingual open-ended generation, featuring 250 culturally grounded prompts in 7 languages, 200 translated prompts in 24 languages, and human-edited versions selected for cross-cultural relevance from English Dolly in 6 languages.
		Dataset
	
The Aya Dataset comprises of two types of data:
Human Annotations: Original annotations (brand new prompts and completions written by annotators) and re-annotations (human edits of automatically generated prompts and completions). 
Demographics Data: Anonymized information for each annotator.
		Load with Datasets
	
To load this dataset consisting of both prompt-completions and demographics data with datasets, you'll just need to install Datasets as pip install datasets --upgrade and then use the following code:
from datasets import load_dataset
# Load the annotations dataset
aya_dataset = load_dataset("CohereForAI/aya_dataset")
# Load the demographics dataset
aya_demographics = load_dataset("CohereForAI/aya_dataset", "demographics")
		Data Fields
	
		Human Annotations (Default)
	
The data fields are the same among all splits:
inputs: Prompt or input to the language model.
targets: Completion or output of the language model.
language: The language of the inputs and targets.
language_code: The ISO code for the language of the inputs and targets.
annotation_type: The value denoting whether inputs and targets are 'original_annotations' or 're-annotations'.
user_id: Unique identifier of the annotator who submitted the prompt-completion pair.
		Demographics Data
	
The data fields are the same among all splits:
user_id: Unique identifier of the annotator who submitted the prompt-completion pair.
age_range: Age of the annotator. Ranges from 0 to 121.
gender: Gender of the annotator. The values are 'male', 'female', 'prefer not to say', 'non-binary' and 'others'.
languages: List of languages spoken by the annotator.
dialects: Dialects reported by the annotator.
Some empty values may be represented as 'null'.

		Motivations & Intentions
	
Curation Rationale: The curation effort employed an open-science approach to create a diverse instruction-style dataset through annotators across the globe that ensures comprehensive representation across all languages. The success of the curation effort, led by volunteers across diverse backgrounds, was significantly influenced by their hope to meaningfully bring NLP advancements to their languages.
		Known Limitations
	
Language and dialect coverage: The dataset covers a limited fraction of the world's linguistic diversity, with 93% of languages not represented, facing challenges in distinguishing between languages and dialects, lacking coverage for many regional dialects, and excluding programming languages.
Uneven distribution of contributions: The dataset contains contributions in annotation activities, with a 'long tail' of annotators making only one or two contributions, leading to potential dataset imbalances across languages and a lack of diversity within certain language annotations.
Cultural and Personal Bias: In the dataset, certain languages have limited representation due to a few dominant annotators, potentially leading to a narrow viewpoint and skewed distribution of content, particularly towards certain domains like news.
Gendered Pronouns: Many of the languages in the Aya Dataset only contain pronouns that are explicitly gendered (e.g., Arabic) or that lack gender-neutral third-person pronouns for gender-neutral reference (e.g. Estonian).
Formality Distinctions: The dataset encompasses languages with diverse formality distinctions, involving honorifics and situational choices in pronoun use, reflecting varying levels of standardization influenced by regional, cultural, and identity factors.
Toxic or Offensive Speech: The Aya Annotation Platform lacked specific flags for toxic speech, relying on human verification and peer review to mitigate offensive content, but there's no guarantee that all potentially offensive data points were removed during the annotation process.
Accounting for mislabeled data: The Aya Annotation Platform lacks re-labeling capabilities, leading to potential mislabeled data in the Aya Dataset, including instances of incorrect language assignments and non-compliance with instruction-style formatting.
