		Dataset Structure
	
		Data Instances
	
A typical data entry in the dataset consists of a question and its corresponding answer. Below is an example from the dataset:
{'question': 'In a highly contested election having multiple candidates, Mr. Jackson, one of the losing candidates, received 3,485,782 votes, which accounted for precisely 38.7 percent of all votes. To have achieved a victory, he would have needed to secure at least 51 percent of all votes. Approximately, what percent of the remaining unsecured votes would Mr. Jackson have needed to accumulate to reach this victory threshold?',
 'answer': "First, let's find out the total number of votes cast in the election. Since Mr. Jackson received 38.7% of all votes, and that amounted to 3,485,782 votes, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of votes (T):\n\n0.387 * T = 3,485,782\n\nNow, solve for T:\n\nT = 3,485,782 / 0.387\nT ≈ 9,000,467 votes (total number of votes cast)\n\nTo win, Mr. Jackson would have needed 51% of the total votes. Let's calculate that amount:\n\n0.51 * T = 0.51 * 9,000,467\n0.51 * T ≈ 4,590,238 votes needed to win\n\nNow, let's find out how many more votes Mr. Jackson needed to reach this winning threshold:\n\nVotes needed to win - Votes Mr. Jackson received = Additional votes needed\n4,590,238 - 3,485,782 = 1,104,456 additional votes needed\n\nNow, let's find out what percentage of the remaining unsecured votes this number represents. The remaining unsecured votes are the votes that were not for Mr. Jackson, which is 100% - 38.7% = 61.3% of the total votes.\n\n61.3% of the total votes is the remaining unsecured votes:\n\n0.613 * T = 0.613 * 9,000,467\n0.613 * T ≈ 5,514,686 votes were unsecured\n\nNow, we'll calculate the percentage of these unsecured votes that the additional votes needed represent:\n\n(Additional votes needed / Unsecured votes) * 100 = Percentage of unsecured votes needed\n(1,104,456 / 5,514,686) * 100 ≈ 20.03%\n\nSo, Mr. Jackson would have needed approximately 20.03% of the remaining unsecured votes to reach the victory threshold of 51%."}
		Data Fields
	
The dataset comprises the following fields:
question: a string containing the question to be answered.
answer: a string containing the answer to the corresponding question.
		Data Splits
	
The dataset is split into a training set. The number of rows in each split is as follows:
train: 200,035 rows
The DatasetDict structure for the dataset is as follows:
DatasetDict({
    'train': Dataset({
        features: ['question', 'answer'],
        num_rows: 200035
    })
})
Each split in the DatasetDict contains a Dataset object with the specified features and number of rows.
