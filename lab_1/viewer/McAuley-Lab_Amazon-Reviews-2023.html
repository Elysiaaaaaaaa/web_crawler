This is a large-scale Amazon Reviews dataset, collected in 2023 by McAuley Lab, and it includes rich features such as:
User Reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes, etc.);
Item Metadata (descriptions, price, raw image, etc.);
Links (user-item / bought together graphs).
		What's New?
	
In the Amazon Reviews'23, we provide:
Larger Dataset: We collected 571.54M reviews, 245.2% larger than the last version;
Newer Interactions: Current interactions range from May. 1996 to Sep. 2023;
Richer Metadata: More descriptive features in item metadata;
Fine-grained Timestamp: Interaction timestamp at the second or finer level;
Cleaner Processing: Cleaner item metadata than previous versions;
Standard Splitting: Standard data splits to encourage RecSys benchmarking.
		Basic Statistics
	
We define the #R_Tokens as the number of tokens in user reviews and #M_Tokens as the number of tokens if treating the dictionaries of item attributes as strings. We emphasize them as important statistics in the era of LLMs.
We count the number of items based on user reviews rather than item metadata files. Note that some items lack metadata.
