		Onto4All: Enhancing Multilingual Conversational AI
	
We are excited to introduce Onto4All which is a subsample of other open source performant conversational datasets. We start with a carefully curated subset of the OpenHermes-2.5-Viet dataset, co-created by @qnguyen3 and @teknium. This dataset is specifically designed to support the training and evaluation of Multilingual language models, such as Vistral-7B-chat and VinaLlama-7B-chat, and is derived from our Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data.
We have included Vietnamese here, but will add more languages.
		Version:
	
This is 0.1.
		Dataset Description
	
For version 0.1, we striped down our OpenHermes-2.5 with 1M data items subsampled to 25,000+ and translated to Vietnamese. The subsampling was done by applying TopicBERT and using consine similarity embedding based clustering to slim down the original dataset.
This dataset includes the following topics:
Role Playing
Context-Aware Question Answering
Agent Prompting
Coding
and more...
The majority of the answers in this dataset were generated by state-of-the-art language models, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1, ensuring high-quality and diverse responses.
We claim no rights to the output generated by other models, and merely redistribute a translation of the orgiginal OpenHermes-2.5 dataset. 
The intention of the dataset is to be used to research multi-lingual abilities of AI models in order to ensure fairness and equal access.

Our own modifications to the OpenHeremes-2.5 dataset is licensed under CC-0. However, the original OpenHermes-2.5 dataset is licensed as set forth here.
Moreover, you should look over the GPT4 and Claude terms of use and consult your advisors for the applicability of using the data for your purposes.
		Acknowledgement
	
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the following individuals and organizations for their invaluable contributions:
@teknium, @autometa, and other open-source dataset creators for the remarkable OpenHermes-2.5 Dataset, which serves as the foundation for ViHermes-25K.
@qnguyen3 and @nampdn-ai for their dedication in translating and regenerating the answers in Vietnamese, making this dataset accessible to the Vietnamese AI community.
We are committed to fostering collaboration and advancement in the field of  natural language processing, and we believe that Onto4All will be a valuable resource for researchers and developers alike.
