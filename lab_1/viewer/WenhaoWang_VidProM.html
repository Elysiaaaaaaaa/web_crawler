		Summary
	
This is the dataset proposed in our paper "VidProM: A Million-scale Real Prompt-Gallery Dataset for Text-to-Video Diffusion Models"
VidProM is the first dataset featuring 1.67 million unique text-to-video prompts and 6.69 million videos generated from 4 different state-of-the-art diffusion models.
It inspires many exciting new research areas, such as Text-to-Video Prompt Engineering, Efficient Video Generation, Fake Video Detection, and Video Copy Detection for Diffusion Models.

Use a clean and modern font for the text "Relate Reality 101." Add a small, stylized heart icon or a thought bubble above or beside the text to represent emotions and thoughts. Consider using a color scheme that includes warm, inviting colors like deep reds, soft blues, or soothing purples to evoke feelings of connection and intrigue.

VidProM_semantic_unique.csv is a semantically unique version of VidProM_unique.csv.
VidProM_embed.hdf5 is the 3072-dim embeddings of our prompts. They are embedded by text-embedding-3-large, which is the latest text embedding model of OpenAI.
It can easily be read by
import numpy as np
import h5py
def read_descriptors(filename):
    hh = h5py.File(filename, "r")
    descs = np.array(hh["embeddings"])
    names = np.array(hh["uuid"][:], dtype=object).astype(str).tolist()
    return names, descs
uuid, features = read_descriptors('VidProM_embed.hdf5')
original_files are the HTML files from official Pika Discord collected by DiscordChatExporter. You can do whatever you want with it under CC BY-NC 4.0 license.
pika_videos, vc2_videos, t2vz_videos, and ms_videos are the generated videos by 4 state-of-the-art text-to-video diffusion models. Each contains 30 tar files.
