		Dataset Summary
	
SWE-bench is a dataset that tests systems’ ability to solve GitHub issues automatically. The dataset collects 2,294 Issue-Pull Request pairs from 12 popular Python. Evaluation is performed by unit test verification using post-PR behavior as the reference solution.
The dataset was released as part of SWE-bench: Can Language Models Resolve Real-World GitHub Issues?
		Want to run inference now?
	
This dataset only contains the problem_statement (i.e. issue text) and the base_commit which can represents the state of the codebase before the issue has been resolved. If you want to run inference using the "Oracle" or BM25 retrieval settings mentioned in the paper, consider the following datasets.
princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_oracle
princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_bm25_13K
princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_bm25_27K
princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_bm25_40K

		Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
	
SWE-bench proposes a new task: issue resolution provided a full repository and GitHub issue. The leaderboard can be found at www.swebench.com
		Languages
	
The text of the dataset is primarily English, but we make no effort to filter or otherwise clean based on language type.

		Data Instances
	
An example of a SWE-bench datum is as follows:
instance_id: (str) - A formatted instance identifier, usually as repo_owner__repo_name-PR-number.
patch: (str) - The gold patch, the patch generated by the PR (minus test-related code), that resolved the issue.
repo: (str) - The repository owner/name identifier from GitHub.
base_commit: (str) - The commit hash of the repository representing the HEAD of the repository before the solution PR is applied.
hints_text: (str) - Comments made on the issue prior to the creation of the solution PR’s first commit creation date.
created_at: (str) - The creation date of the pull request.
test_patch: (str) - A test-file patch that was contributed by the solution PR.
problem_statement: (str) - The issue title and body.
version: (str) - Installation version to use for running evaluation.
environment_setup_commit: (str) - commit hash to use for environment setup and installation.
FAIL_TO_PASS: (str) - A json list of strings that represent the set of tests resolved by the PR and tied to the issue resolution.
PASS_TO_PASS: (str) - A json list of strings that represent tests that should pass before and after the PR application.
