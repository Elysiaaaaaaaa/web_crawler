		HPLT Monolingual Release v1.2
	
This repository contains the means to access the datasets created by the HPLT project. These large-scale web-crawled corpora based on CommonCrawl and the Internet Archive are accessible in 75 languages. The full dump is available as well as deduplicated and further cleaned versions depending on the config that you use (see the usage example below).
		Prerequisites
	
HPLT compresses their files with zst so to use this library you need to make sure that zstandard is installed:
pip install zstandard
		Usage
	
You can download either the full portion of the data (e.g. nl), its deduplicated set (nl_deduplicated), or the fully cleaned set (nl_cleaned).
You'll soon need to use trust_remote_code=True to download this dataset. This is required so that downloading the dataset can be done directly from HPLT.
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset(
