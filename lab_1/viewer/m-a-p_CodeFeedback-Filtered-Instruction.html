OpenCodeInterpreter is a family of open-source code generation systems designed to bridge the gap between large language models and advanced proprietary systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. It significantly advances code generation capabilities by integrating execution and iterative refinement functionalities.

		Dataset Description
	
CodeFeedback-Filtered-Instruction is a curated collection of code instruction queries extracted from four prominent open-source code instruction tuning datasets: Magicoder-OSS-Instruct, Python code subset of ShareGPT, Magicoder-Evol-Instruct, and Evol-Instruct-Code. 
Initially, 287k queries were aggregated from these datasets. To isolate the most intricate and informative instructions, a rigorous filtering process was employed. 
This involved utilizing the Qwen-72B-Chat, an open-source chat model, for selective filtering. 
The code queries are evaluated along with their corresponding responses within the compiled datasets by the LLM, assigning a complexity score ranging from 1 to 5, and only those rated 4 or 5 were retained for the seed set. 
This meticulous filtering process resulted in a final collection of 156k high-quality single-turn code instructions.
In subsequent processing steps mentioned in the paper, besides Single-turn Packing, we exclusively utilized queries without considering responses. However, here we retained all responses to provide users with more convenient usage options.
