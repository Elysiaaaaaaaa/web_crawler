(However, there are four seats and all are attached.)&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;To solve this problem, we can use the principle of counting. We have four people (Jeonghee, Cheolsu, Eunsu, and Minjun) and four seats. We want to find the number of ways they can sit such that Eunsu and Minjun, who can't watch horror movies, do not sit next to each other.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways four people can sit in four seats without any restrictions. This is a simple permutation problem, where we have 4 options for the first seat, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the last seat. So, the total number of ways is 4! (4 factorial), which is 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 24.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which Eunsu and Minjun do sit next to each other, and then we will subtract this from the total number of ways to get the number of ways in which they do not sit next to each other.\n\nWhen Eunsu and Minjun sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single unit. Now we have three units to arrange: Jeonghee, Cheolsu, and the Eunsu-Minjun unit. There are 3! = 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 6 ways to arrange these three units.\n\nHowever, within the Eunsu-Minjun unit, Eunsu and Minjun can switch places, which gives us 2! = 2 ways to arrange them within that unit.\n\nSo, the number of ways in which Eunsu and Minjun do sit next to each other is 3! Ã— 2! = 6 Ã— 2 = 12.\n\nFinally, to find the number of ways in which Eunsu and Minjun do not sit next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they do sit next to each other from the total number of ways:\n\nTotal ways - Ways they sit next to each other = 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 cases in which the four people can sit in a row with Eunsu and Minjun not sitting next to each other.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;There are two types of Korean language workbooks and four types of math workbooks.

Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, we have:\n\n3 kilograms = 3 * 1000 grams = 3000 grams\n300 grams are already in grams.\n\nSo, the total amount of strawberries in grams is:\n3000 grams + 300 grams = 3300 grams\n\nNow, let's convert the amount given to the friend to grams:\n\n1 kilogram = 1 * 1000 grams = 1000 grams\n900 grams are already in grams.\n\nSo, the amount given to the friend in grams is:\n1000 grams + 900 grams = 1900 grams\n\nNow, let's subtract the amount given to the friend from the total amount to find out how many grams are left:\n\n3300 grams - 1900 grams = 1400 grams\n\nTherefore, there are 1400 grams of strawberries left.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:93,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Miae made a square with a side of 20 centimeters (cm) using wire. Using a wire of the same length as this one, Taehee made a rectangle wide 14 centimeters (cm). How many centimeters (cm) is the length of the rectangle Taehee made?&quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;First, let's calculate the length of the wire Miae used to make the square. Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the total length of the wire by multiplying the length of one side by 4.\n\nLength of wire for the square = Side of square Ã— 4\nLength of wire for the square = 20 cm Ã— 4\nLength of wire for the square = 80 cm\n\nNow, Taehee used the same length of wire to make a rectangle. We know the width of the rectangle is 14 cm, and we need to find the length. Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\nPerimeter of rectangle = 2 Ã— (Length + Width)\n\nSince Taehee used the same length of wire as Miae, the perimeter of Taehee's rectangle is also 80 cm.\n\n80 cm = 2 Ã— (L + 14 cm)\n\nNow, let's solve for L:\n\n80 cm = 2L + 28 cm\n80 cm - 28 cm = 2L\n52 cm = 2L\nL = 52 cm / 2\nL = 26 cm\n\nSo, the length of the rectangle Taehee made is 26 centimeters.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:94,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Suppose that street trees are planted on the road that is 2575 meters (m) long at intervals of 25 meters (m).

To find the third smallest, we need to sort these numbers. The smallest numbers will start with the smallest tens digit, which is 2, followed by 3, then 7, and finally 8.\n\nThe smallest number is 23.78, the second smallest is 23.87, and the third smallest is 27.38.\n\nTherefore, the third smallest number is 27.38.&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:97,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Taehyung is trying to divide 21/11 liters (L) of water into 7/11 liters (L) per cup, and Hoseok is trying to divide 8/17 liters (L) of water into 2/17 liters (L) per cup.

x / 10 = 6
x = 6 * 10
x = 60

2) M_m + 13 = 2(M + 13) (After 13 years, the mother's age will be twice Minsu's age)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 1, we can express M_m in terms of M:

M_m = M + 28

Now, let's substitute M_m in equation 2 with the expression we found from equation 1:

(M + 28) + 13 = 2(M + 13)

Simplify the equation:

M + 41 = 2M + 26

Now, let's solve for M:

2M - M = 41 - 26
M = 15

So, Minsu is currently 15 years old.</div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto">To solve this problem, we can use the principle of counting. We have four people (Jeonghee, Cheolsu, Eunsu, and Minjun) and four seats. We want to find the number of ways they can sit such that Eunsu and Minjun, who can't watch horror movies, do not sit next to each other.

First, let's find the total number of ways four people can sit in four seats without any restrictions. This is a simple permutation problem, where we have 4 options for the first seat, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the last seat. So, the total number of ways is 4! (4 factorial), which is 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 24.

Now, let's find the number of ways in which Eunsu and Minjun do sit next to each other, and then we will subtract this from the total number of ways to get the number of ways in which they do not sit next to each other.

When Eunsu and Minjun sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single unit. Now we have three units to arrange: Jeonghee, Cheolsu, and the Eunsu-Minjun unit. There are 3! = 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 6 ways to arrange these three units.

However, within the Eunsu-Minjun unit, Eunsu and Minjun can switch places, which gives us 2! = 2 ways to arrange them within that unit.

So, the number of ways in which Eunsu and Minjun do sit next to each other is 3! Ã— 2! = 6 Ã— 2 = 12.

Finally, to find the number of ways in which Eunsu and Minjun do not sit next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they do sit next to each other from the total number of ways:

Total ways - Ways they sit next to each other = 24 - 12 = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 cases in which the four people can sit in a row with Eunsu and Minjun not sitting next to each other.</div></div>

Since the order in which we arrange the numbers matters (for example, 136 is different from 361), we are dealing with permutations.

The number of ways to choose 3 different numbers from a set of 4 is given by the formula for permutations without repetition, which is:

P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!

Where:
- n is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 4),
- r is the number of items to choose (in this case, 3),
- "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number (for example, 4! = 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 24).

So, the number of permutations of 3 different numbers from the set of 4 is:

P(4, 3) = 4! / (4 - 3)!
P(4, 3) = 4! / 1!
P(4, 3) = (4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1) / (1)
P(4, 3) = 24

Therefore, you can make 24 different three-digit numbers from the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 7.</div></div>

Since both distances are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 15t = 10(t + 0.5) \]

Now, we solve for \( t \):
\[ 15t = 10t + 5 \]

Number of black stones = Total number of stones - Number of white stones
Number of black stones = 928 - 713
Number of black stones = 215

Now, to find the difference between the number of white stones and black stones, we subtract the number of black stones from the number of white stones.

Now, we need to determine what A could be to make the number A3B a three-digit number that when subtracted by 41 equals 591. Since we are dealing with whole numbers, A must be a digit from 0 to 9.

Let's try to find A by dividing 632 by 100 (since A is in the hundreds place):

632 Ã· 100 = 6.32

Since A must be a whole number, we can see that A = 6 because 6 is the whole number part of the quotient.

According to the problem, when x is divided by 6, it becomes 1/10. We can write this as an equation:

x / 6 = 1/10

To find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 6 * (1/10)
x = 6/10
x = 3/5

Now we have the value of x, which is 3/5.

Next, we want to find the value of x divided by 3/25. We can write this as:

(3/5) / (3/25)

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:

(3/5) * (25/3)

Now, we can simplify by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator:

(3/5) * (25/3) = (3 * 25) / (5 * 3) = 25/5

25/5 simplifies to:

25/5 = 5

So, the value of the number (which is 3/5) divided by 3/25 is 5.</div></div>

Let's list out all the possible two-digit combinations that can be formed with the digits 1, 3, 5, and 6, and then check which of them are multiples of 4:

Possible two-digit combinations:
13, 15, 16, 31, 35, 36, 51, 53, 56, 61, 63, 65

Now, let's check which of these are multiples of 4:
- 13 is not a multiple of 4.
- 15 is not a multiple of 4.
- 16 is a multiple of 4 (4 * 4 = 16).
- 31 is not a multiple of 4.
- 35 is not a multiple of 4.
- 36 is a multiple of 4 (4 * 9 = 36).
- 51 is not a multiple of 4.
- 53 is not a multiple of 4.
- 56 is a multiple of 4 (4 * 14 = 56).
- 61 is not a multiple of 4.
- 63 is not a multiple of 4.
- 65 is not a multiple of 4.

So, the two-digit combinations that are multiples of 4 are: 16, 36, and 56.

For each of these combinations, we can form two four-digit numbers by placing the remaining two digits at the front. For example, with the combination 16, we can form the numbers 5316 and 3516.

Let's do this for each of the multiples of 4:

For 16:
- 5316
- 3516

For 36:
- 5136
- 1536

For 56:
- 3156
- 1356

In total, we have 6 four-digit numbers that are multiples of 4.</div></div>

According to the problem, when N is divided by 9, we get a quotient which we'll call Q. Then, when Q is divided by 9, the quotient is 25 and the remainder is 7.

So, we can write the second division as:
Q = 9 * 25 + 7

Now, let's calculate Q:
Q = 9 * 25 + 7
Q = 225 + 7
Q = 232

Now, we know that N divided by 9 equals Q. So we can write:
N = 9 * Q

Substitute the value of Q we found into the equation:
N = 9 * 232
N = 2088

Therefore, the number we are looking for is 2088.</div></div>

First, let's find the total number of ways to order 1 coffee. Since there are 5 types of hot coffee and 4 types of cold coffee, there are a total of \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) types of coffee.

Next, let's find the total number of ways to order 1 bread. Since there are 3 types of cookies and 5 types of muffins, there are a total of \( 3 + 5 = 8 \) types of bread.

Now, to find the total number of cases where you order 1 coffee and 1 bread, you multiply the number of coffee choices by the number of bread choices:

\( 9 \) (types of coffee) \( \times 8 \) (types of bread) \( = 72 \) cases.

A = 1000 + 1600 + 280
A = 2600 + 280
A = 2880

Now, let's calculate the value of B:

B is calculated as 3 jumps from 355 with an interval of 245. This means we add 245 to 355 three times.

First jump: 355 + 245 = 600
Second jump: 600 + 245 = 845
Third jump: 845 + 245 = 1090

So, B = 1090

2. Two sides that are 10 cm wide and 2 cm high.
3. The bottom that is 18 cm long and 10 cm wide.

Let's calculate the area of each:

1. The area of one long side is 18 cm * 2 cm = 36 cmÂ². Since there are two such sides, their combined area is 36 cmÂ² * 2 = 72 cmÂ².

2. The area of one short side is 10 cm * 2 cm = 20 cmÂ². Since there are two such sides, their combined area is 20 cmÂ² * 2 = 40 cmÂ².

3. The area of the bottom is 18 cm * 10 cm = 180 cmÂ².

Now, let's sum up these areas to find the total area that needs to be painted:

Total area = Area of long sides + Area of short sides + Area of bottom
Total area = 72 cmÂ² + 40 cmÂ² + 180 cmÂ²

There were also 5 pieces left over before the classmate came in. So the total number of pizza slices was:
84 pieces (taken by students) + 5 pieces (left over) = 89 pieces

Now, Seoyoon's classmate joins, making the total number of people to share the pizza 8. We need to divide the 89 pieces among 8 people.

89 pieces / 8 people = 11 pieces/person with 1 piece remaining

The white car is 11th from the left.

Now, we can calculate the number of cars between the black and white cars by subtracting the position of the black car from the position of the white car and then subtracting 1 (because we don't want to include one of the cars in the count).

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms.

Since we are looking for the sum of 100 consecutive odd numbers starting from 1, the first term (a1) is 1, and the number of terms (n) is 100.

To find the last term (an), we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where d is the common difference between the terms. For odd numbers, the common difference is 2 (since each odd number is 2 more than the previous odd number).

So, the last term (an) is:

an = 1 + (100 - 1) * 2
an = 1 + 99 * 2
an = 1 + 198
an = 199

Now we can find the sum:

Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term)
Sum = 100/2 * (1 + 199)
Sum = 50 * 200
Sum = 10000

Therefore, the sum of the first 100 consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 is 10,000.</div></div>

So, the total length L can be calculated as follows:

L = length of the first strip + (length of each subsequent strip - overlap) * (number of subsequent strips)
L = 25 cm + (25 cm - 6 cm) * 29
L = 25 cm + 19 cm * 29

   Number of tangerines = 24 + 18
   Number of tangerines = 42

So, there are 42 tangerines.</div></div>

\[ P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \]

In this case, we have n = 2 (two books to place) and r = 2 (two spots available), so:

\[ P(2, 2) = \frac{2!}{(2-2)!} = \frac{2!}{0!} = \frac{2 \times 1}{1} = 2 \]

So there are 2 ways to place books D and E on the shelf. Since the order of A, B, and C is fixed, the total number of ways to place all five books on the shelf is also 2.</div></div>

The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 because 20 is the smallest number that both 4 and 5 can divide into without leaving a remainder.

Now, we need to find the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 20.

The smallest three-digit number is 100, but it is not a multiple of 20. To find the smallest three-digit multiple of 20, we can divide 100 by 20 and then take the ceiling of the result to find the next whole number multiple:

100 Ã· 20 = 5 (remainder 0)

Since 100 is already a multiple of 20, the smallest three-digit multiple of 20 is 100.

The largest three-digit number is 999, but it is not a multiple of 20. To find the largest three-digit multiple of 20, we can divide 999 by 20 and then take the floor of the result to find the previous whole number multiple:

999 Ã· 20 = 49 (remainder 19)

The largest whole number multiple of 20 before 999 is 49 Ã— 20 = 980.

Now, we need to count how many multiples of 20 there are between 100 and 980 inclusive. We can do this by subtracting the smallest multiple from the largest multiple and then dividing by 20, and finally adding 1 to include both endpoints:

(980 - 100) Ã· 20 + 1 = 880 Ã· 20 + 1 = 44 + 1 = 45

Therefore, there are 45 three-digit numbers that are common multiples of 4 and 5.</div></div>

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto">To find the sum of the digits of the even numbers from 600 to 800, we need to first identify all the even numbers in that range and then sum up their digits.

The even numbers from 600 to 800 are: 600, 602, 604, 606, ..., 798, 800.

Let's break down the process:

1. Identify the even numbers.
2. Sum the digits of each even number.
3. Add the sums together.

Since there are many numbers to consider, we can look for a pattern to simplify the process.

For the hundreds digit, we have '6' for numbers from 600 to 699, '7' for numbers from 700 to 799, and '8' for the number 800. Since we are only considering even numbers, the units digit will alternate between 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. The tens digit will go from 0 to 9 and then repeat.

Let's calculate the sum of the digits for each hundred:

For 600-699:
- Hundreds digit sum: 6 * 50 (since there are 50 even numbers in this range)
- Tens digit sum: (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) * 5 (since each digit appears 5 times as the tens digit in the even numbers)
- Units digit sum: (0+2+4+6+8) * 10 (since each digit appears 10 times as the units digit in the even numbers)

For 700-799:
- Hundreds digit sum: 7 * 50
- Tens digit sum: (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) * 5
- Units digit sum: (0+2+4+6+8) * 10

For 800:
- Hundreds digit sum: 8
- Tens digit sum: 0
- Units digit sum: 0

Now, let's calculate the sums:

For 600-699:
- Hundreds digit sum: 6 * 50 = 300
- Tens digit sum: (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) * 5 = 45 * 5 = 225
- Units digit sum: (0+2+4+6+8) * 10 = 20 * 10 = 200

For 700-799:
- Hundreds digit sum: 7 * 50 = 350
- Tens digit sum: 225 (same as above)
- Units digit sum: 200 (same as above)

For 800:
- Hundreds digit sum: 8
- Tens digit sum: 0
- Units digit sum: 0

Adding these sums together:

600-699: 300 + 225 + 200 = 725
700-799: 350 + 225 + 200 = 775
800: 8 + 0 + 0 = 8

Total sum: 725 + 775 + 8 = 1508

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the even numbers from 600 to 800 is 1508.</div></div>

x - 7/3 = 3/2

To find x, we need to add 7/3 to both sides of the equation:

x - 7/3 + 7/3 = 3/2 + 7/3

This simplifies to:

x = 3/2 + 7/3

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 2 and 3 is 6. So we convert each fraction:

3/2 = 9/6 (because 3 * 3 = 9 and 2 * 3 = 6)
7/3 = 14/6 (because 7 * 2 = 14 and 3 * 2 = 6)

Now we can add them:

x = 9/6 + 14/6
x = (9 + 14) / 6
x = 23/6

So the number we're looking for is 23/6. Now, if we add 7/3 to that number:

23/6 + 7/3

Again, we need a common denominator, which is still 6. We convert 7/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 6:

7/3 = 14/6

Now we add them:

23/6 + 14/6 = (23 + 14) / 6
= 37/6

So the result of adding 7/3 to the number is 37/6.</div></div>

So, the total amount of strawberries in grams is:
3000 grams + 300 grams = 3300 grams

Now, let's convert the amount given to the friend to grams:

1 kilogram = 1 * 1000 grams = 1000 grams
900 grams are already in grams.

So, the amount given to the friend in grams is:
1000 grams + 900 grams = 1900 grams

Now, let's subtract the amount given to the friend from the total amount to find out how many grams are left:

3300 grams - 1900 grams = 1400 grams

Therefore, there are 1400 grams of strawberries left.</div></div>

Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the total length of the wire by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

Length of wire for the square = Side of square Ã— 4
Length of wire for the square = 20 cm Ã— 4
Length of wire for the square = 80 cm

Now, Taehee used the same length of wire to make a rectangle. We know the width of the rectangle is 14 cm, and we need to find the length. Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Perimeter of rectangle = 2 Ã— (Length + Width)

Since Taehee used the same length of wire as Miae, the perimeter of Taehee's rectangle is also 80 cm.

80 cm = 2 Ã— (L + 14 cm)

Now, let's solve for L:

80 cm = 2L + 28 cm
80 cm - 28 cm = 2L
52 cm = 2L
L = 52 cm / 2
L = 26 cm

So, the length of the rectangle Taehee made is 26 centimeters.</div></div>

Number of intervals = Total length of the road / Interval length
Number of intervals = 2575 meters / 25 meters
Number of intervals = 103

Since trees are planted at each interval and also at the beginning and end of the road, we need to add one more tree to the total number of intervals.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto">To find the third smallest number using the digits 3, 8, 2, and 7, we first need to list out the possible two-decimal-digit numbers that can be made using these digits without repetition.

Let's start by listing the possible numbers with the smallest digit, 2, in the tens place:
- 23.78
- 23.87
- 27.38
- 27.83
- 28.37
- 28.73

Next, we list the possible numbers with the next smallest digit, 3, in the tens place:
- 32.78
- 32.87
- 37.28
- 37.82
- 38.27
- 38.72

Now, we list the possible numbers with the digit 7 in the tens place:
- 72.38
- 72.83
- 73.28
- 73.82
- 78.23
- 78.32

Finally, we list the possible numbers with the largest digit, 8, in the tens place:
- 82.37
- 82.73
- 83.27
- 83.72
- 87.23
- 87.32

Now we have all the possible two-decimal-digit numbers using the digits 3, 8, 2, and 7 once. To find the third smallest, we need to sort these numbers. The smallest numbers will start with the smallest tens digit, which is 2, followed by 3, then 7, and finally 8.

The smallest number is 23.78, the second smallest is 23.87, and the third smallest is 27.38.

Therefore, the third smallest number is 27.38.</div></div>

For Taehyung:
He has 21/11 liters of water and wants to divide it into cups of 7/11 liters each. To find out how many cups he will need, we divide the total amount of water by the amount per cup:

(21/11) Ã· (7/11) = (21 Ã· 7) / (11 Ã· 11) = 3 / 1 = 3 cups

Taehyung will need 3 cups.

For Hoseok:
He has 8/17 liters of water and wants to divide it into cups of 2/17 liters each. To find out how many cups he will need, we divide the total amount of water by the amount per cup:

(8/17) Ã· (2/17) = (8 Ã· 2) / (17 Ã· 17) = 4 / 1 = 4 cups

Hoseok will need 4 cups.

In conclusion, Taehyung will need 3 cups and Hoseok will need 4 cups to divide all the water they each have into the cups.</div></div>

1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters. So, to convert 900 meters to kilometers, we divide by 1000.

900 meters / 1000 = 0.9 kilometers

Now, Jaeyeon runs 0.9 kilometers every day. Since he practiced for 5 days, we multiply his daily distance by 5 to find his total distance.

0.9 kilometers/day * 5 days = 4.5 kilometers

Now we can compare the total distances:

Eunbi ran a total of 4.3 kilometers in 5 days.
Jaeyeon ran a total of 4.5 kilometers in 5 days.

Jaeyeon ran more, with a total of 4.5 kilometers compared to Eunbi's 4.3 kilometers.</div></div>

<p>A typical data entry in the dataset consists of a question and its corresponding answer. Below is an example from the dataset:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{<span class="hljs-string">'question'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'In a highly contested election having multiple candidates, Mr. Jackson, one of the losing candidates, received 3,485,782 votes, which accounted for precisely 38.7 percent of all votes. To have achieved a victory, he would have needed to secure at least 51 percent of all votes. Approximately, what percent of the remaining unsecured votes would Mr. Jackson have needed to accumulate to reach this victory threshold?'</span>,
 <span class="hljs-string">'answer'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"First, let's find out the total number of votes cast in the election. Since Mr. Jackson received 38.7% of all votes, and that amounted to 3,485,782 votes, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of votes (T):\n\n0.387 * T = 3,485,782\n\nNow, solve for T:\n\nT = 3,485,782 / 0.387\nT â‰ˆ 9,000,467 votes (total number of votes cast)\n\nTo win, Mr. Jackson would have needed 51% of the total votes. Let's calculate that amount:\n\n0.51 * T = 0.51 * 9,000,467\n0.51 * T â‰ˆ 4,590,238 votes needed to win\n\nNow, let's find out how many more votes Mr. Jackson needed to reach this winning threshold:\n\nVotes needed to win - Votes Mr. Jackson received = Additional votes needed\n4,590,238 - 3,485,782 = 1,104,456 additional votes needed\n\nNow, let's find out what percentage of the remaining unsecured votes this number represents. The remaining unsecured votes are the votes that were not for Mr. Jackson, which is 100% - 38.7% = 61.3% of the total votes.\n\n61.3% of the total votes is the remaining unsecured votes:\n\n0.613 * T = 0.613 * 9,000,467\n0.613 * T â‰ˆ 5,514,686 votes were unsecured\n\nNow, we'll calculate the percentage of these unsecured votes that the additional votes needed represent:\n\n(Additional votes needed / Unsecured votes) * 100 = Percentage of unsecured votes needed\n(1,104,456 / 5,514,686) * 100 â‰ˆ 20.03%\n\nSo, Mr. Jackson would have needed approximately 20.03% of the remaining unsecured votes to reach the victory threshold of 51%."</span>}
