We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.\nWe expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.\nAs we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.\nNow, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.\nFinally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued.

We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.\nWe expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.\nAs we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.\nNow, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.\nFinally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.\nThis concluding our key message.

And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.\nNow let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.\n5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.\nWe are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.\ndollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.\nAs a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.\nWe are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.\nWe have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.\nN3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.\nOur 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced.

And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.\nNow let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.\n5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.\nWe are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.\ndollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.\nAs a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.\nWe are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.\nWe have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.\nN3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.\nOur 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced.

I think volume-wise, for us, we expect, as we said, we expect to continue to gain share over time. We have been doing it, as you can validate with the growth rates we have reported quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year.

But I encourage you to look at the at the 6G white paper published by Samsung, which is publicly available and to get a flavor on how the entire world is already moving to the next step. So when you talk about the cycle, the cycles on next-generation wireless connectivity hasn't really finished the 4G yet.\nWe are talking about 5G now and others, a lot of people talk about 6G, too. So it's not going to end quickly because the need for connectivity increases and continues to increase and drive the new requirements that need new solutions. And so there will be ups and downs, of course, over time. But I think the much denser type of network connectivity that is required by the 5G infrastructure, I think, will require volume deployments that we haven't obviously experienced in the past.\nAnd of course, with that, all the data storage increase in worldwide will also require an increased level of connectivity that it just wasn't there in the past. So I think the demand will be very healthy for quite some time.\nChris Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\nThank you guys.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nWanted to talk about 3D Sensing. Typically, September quarter is the strongest, but there's some belief that some of this demand will be slipping into the December quarter. Is that your perception?\nMary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, go ahead, Giovanni.\nGiovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President\nI'm sorry, you were talking about the 3D Sensing?\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nYes. Typically, September is strongest, but some of that now might be shifting more into December than traditionally?\nGiovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President\nI don't know, I don't see that. But we have a multiple design wins that are ramping. And so I don't believe there will be any particular pattern of shipments and so forth other than maybe what we experienced in the past. I think some of the designs will balance with each other in terms of the demand and the pull in.\nSo I think it will be I would expect a similar ramp and the similar demand that we've seen in the past. I think volume-wise, for us, we expect, as we said, we expect to continue to gain share over time. We have been doing it, as you can validate with the growth rates we have reported quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Obviously, we are growing much faster than market, much, much faster than that.\nSo we expect that, that is an indication of a share gain, and we continue to do that.\nMary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer\nLet me just add to that before we finish up, and Mark, I'll give you your follow-up. But at least for the last two years for our company, maybe for all the years we've shipped, the 12/31 quarter has consistently been stronger than 9/30. So that's what made Q3 and Q4 3/31 and 6/30 being higher than the 12/31 kind of remarkable. But generally speaking, we have not actually seen all the shipments going out in 9/30 quarter.\nSorry, Mark, go ahead.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nLast question for me is ROADM, I assume that was strong. Any color on that?\nMary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo yes, so go ahead, Giovanni.\nGiovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President\nYes. Yes, absolutely. ROADM is an integral part of out in traffic at the fiscal layer, as you know. And as I said, the new network architectures out there that require way more flexibility to provision traffic at the right place at the right time, really increased the demand for the kind of products versus the previous network architecture.\nSo it has been very strong for us.\nMark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you.

We are excited to see our 5G business continuing to flourish and are looking forward to broader deployment of 5G in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and India.\nIn addition, we anticipate significant share in content growth ahead and new opportunities in ORAN and DRAM architectures. As you will recall, in March 2020, Nokia and Marvell announced that our companies have started working together to develop a leading 5G silicon including multiple generations of custom silicon and infrastructure processors to further expand the range of Nokia's ReefShark chipsets. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our collaboration with Nokia to further advance their 5G chipset portfolio. Nokia will be using our new OCTEON 10 DPU, the industry's leading 5G transport processor built on Marvell's cutting-edge five-nanometer platform and hardware acceleration technology.\nThese high-performance and highly efficient processors will allow operators to scale rapidly and manage the dramatic increase in data traffic and performance demanded by 5G's innovative service-based architecture while reducing cost and energy consumption. We continue to expand our collaboration with Nokia and look forward to enabling their next-generation 5G platforms. There are also two key announcements from the Open RAN ecosystem. Vodafone and Nokia announced that they have agreed to work on a fully compliant Open RAN solution with Marvell.\nDeveloping cooperation with us, Nokia's ReefShark SoC boosts Layer-1 processing capability to enable Open RAN systems to reach full functionality and performance parity with traditional mobile radio networks. In another development, Vodafone and Samsung recently announced that they are jointly cooperating with Marvell to accelerate the performance and adoption of 5G Open RAN across Europe. They plan on incorporating Marvell's advanced OCTEON Fusion processor specifically designed for Open RAN into the latest off-the-shelf servers. The specialized accelerator chip also enables massive MIMO technology developed to serve many subscribers in dense urban areas.\nMoving on to our outlook for next quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from our carrier end market to grow slightly on a sequential basis and grow year over year approximately in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $376 million, growing 52% year over year and 10% sequentially.\nAs the quarter progressed, our Chinese customers started to turn cautious due to an evolving macroeconomic environment. In response, we work with customers realigning shipments to reflect their reduced demand. As a result, despite the strong sequential and year-over-year growth, revenue was lower than our guidance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from the enterprise networking end market to decline sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis.\nHowever, we expect growth to continue year over year at close to 40%, reflecting our higher content and growing share. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, growing 26% year over year and 1% sequentially. Revenue was lower than our forecast in industrial, as well as automotive where we continue to experience supply challenges in certain legacy notes.\nWe expect these supply challenges to start to improve in our fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our auto business continued to grow, partially offset by a decline in our industrial business. On a year-over-year basis in this end market, Marvell's growth was primarily from our auto business, driven by continuing adoption of our Ethernet technology.

Turning to our licensing business. Our second-quarter results reflect the strength of our unmatched patent portfolio value. We are the global 5G IP leader with more than 130 5G license agreements signed to date, up from over 120 last quarter with all major handset manufacturers around the globe licensed.\nWe continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G, which we expect to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its impact on multiple industries. We believe that our model of early research and development, consistent standards leadership, flexible licensing, and global implementation support will continue to add value to our partners and stockholders for years to come. Overall, we continue to see unprecedented demand across all of our technologies and businesses as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. Despite the industrywide semiconductor supply shortage, we're utilizing our scale and working across our entire global supply chain to maximize our ability to capture this opportunity.\nWe expect material improvements by the end of the calendar year due to planned capacity builds and multi-sourcing initiatives. As one of the leading drivers of advanced semiconductor technology platforms, we're also excited to see more foundry investment in the United States consistent with the United States government's strategic priorities. Finally, we're extremely proud of our collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Ingenuity, the Mars helicopter powered by Snapdragon. Snapdragon made it to Mars and helped power the first-ever autonomous flight on another planet.\nThis is yet another example of our ingenuity. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.\nAkash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong second-quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 52% and 116% in revenue and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT. In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74%, both above the high end of our guidance range.\nThe outperformance was primarily driven by stronger handset shipments, especially in China. In addition, our results include a benefit of approximately $80 million from adjustments to prior-quarter royalty estimates. In QCT, we delivered revenues of $6.3 billion and EBT of $1.6 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 53% while EBT grew 137%, delivering on our commitment to increase operating leverage.\nWe achieved the high end of our guidance range with EBT margins of 25%. This reflects our strong operating performance driven by favorable product mix and gross margins, which more than offset a reduction in the orders within the quarter by a global handset OEM. RF front-end revenues increased 39% year over year to approximately $900 million on the strength of our product portfolio across 4G, 5G sub-6, and 5G millimeter wave. 5G millimeter wave products accounted for less than 20% of our second-quarter RF front-end revenues.\nWe expect millimeter wave deployments in other regions, such as China, to be a tailwind for long-term revenue growth.

We are pleased to report strong second-quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 52% and 116% in revenue and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT. In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74%, both above the high end of our guidance range.\nThe outperformance was primarily driven by stronger handset shipments, especially in China. In addition, our results include a benefit of approximately $80 million from adjustments to prior-quarter royalty estimates. In QCT, we delivered revenues of $6.3 billion and EBT of $1.6 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 53% while EBT grew 137%, delivering on our commitment to increase operating leverage.\nWe achieved the high end of our guidance range with EBT margins of 25%. This reflects our strong operating performance driven by favorable product mix and gross margins, which more than offset a reduction in the orders within the quarter by a global handset OEM.

As my follow-up, I wanted to -- I want to ask you about content growth at your lead customer, but I know you won't go there. But I was hoping maybe you can give us a little more detail on sort of the frequency band support that will be needed as we move from one 5G phone to the next generation. In other words, the cycles within the cycle, so to speak, as it relates to their interfaces.\nWhat sort of content growth do you think you can see long term and broad market related as these flagship phones need to support more frequency bands, in particular, things like millimeter wave support. And then, related to that, perhaps what your current stance is with respect to millimeter wave?\nLiam Griffin -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President\nSure. Well, I mean, as you've seen, the frequency opportunities continue to expand. If you look at the C-band auction, for example, that opened up a tremendous amount of technology, three to six gig, where we can capitalize immediately. I think the appetite -- if we go high level, the appetite for this technology is really strong, right? The mobile technology that we see every year gets more complex, more challenging, whether it's in China, whether it's in the US, and we love that because we're a company that focuses on the high end, we focus on technology, we focus on excellence in our products and we see that opportunity be rewarded with our customers.\nSo we can hit all of those nodes, whether it's a China play, whether it's the high end of the US, and we've grown the technology along with it. So that's how we go to market. There's nothing new about the news around Huawei or anything like that, all that stuff is completely understood. Millimeter wave, you mentioned.\nMillimeter wave is an interesting technology. It works in certain areas. It has some drawbacks as well that are well known. And we listen to our customers, and we have great engagement with all the players that we need to work with.\nAnd together, we resolve the complexity and work on the end market solution. So we have investments across that entire spectrum. We know what we need to do to win. We also know what we need to do to allow our customers to win.\nAnd that's the recipe that's been working.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my question. I just want to revisit the September guide. So I guess when you look at it on an organic basis, it's a little over $100 million sequentially. If you look back last year, your lead customer kind of contributed to that amount.\nAnd with the earlier launch and content gains, we should think it would be more. So just trying to understand, are there some segments that are down? Or are you adding some conservatism? Just trying to understand with the acquisition, I know it's a great sequential, but just from looking at the moving pieces, should be a bit more in my mind. So just trying to figure out what I'm missing.\nKris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo, Blayne, I think as we indicated, it's -- organically, we see double-digit sequential growth into September, both in our mobile and broad markets business. And we have really done well and executed well on the design win side. We have higher content in multiple phones at all OEMs that are launching, and that will be launched here in the next couple of months or so. And so, it -- sometimes, it becomes a little bit of a unit play.\nSo we -- as you know, we always are somewhat conservative in our unit assumptions. There is definitely strong demand for the products. We do take into account, as Liam earlier expressed, some of the global supply issues which are there, right? And we need 100 parts to make a phone.

As I mentioned before they're significant densification efforts going on in all of the markets. You can always go market by market and look at various metrics, and you can do -- you can see that there is a significant new infrastructure that needs to be added. New sites need to be added in those markets to be able to support the growth that they have going on in those markets.\nAnd so, as we've always said, as you well know, the international markets are a couple of technologies behind generally. And so -- and without any really strong wireline capability and so on. And a pandemic even the market to the world that we're living in today there's even more of a demand for wireless infrastructure in those markets. And so, I think all of that gives a good backdrop for what we would expect growth to look like in the, Internationally in those markets.\nWe've always said it's going to be two basis points to 300 basis points faster than we're seeing in the United States. And if you take a look at even in Q3, you look at Latin America, you look at Africa they're all up in 7% to 8% range. And so, it's -- the model works. I think the strategy works and we're very bullish in terms of what we're expecting to see in our international markets over the next several years.\nJon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThe 5,500 deals that upsized our outlook that you gave us to any kind of a regional pick out that you could provide.\nTom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI mean, I think we have. I mean to give the one. I mean India was up a bit. We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there.\nSo there's an outsized, probably piece of that 500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria markets, like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets where we're seeing upticks in the overall bill to suit the activity.\nBrazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today. I think to be able to meet the demand and provide a good quality signal, and so we're seeing increased demand for site builds in Brazil as well. So it's a bit of a mixed across the three of them I'd say.\nAnd I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to see continued increases in rates that built the suits going forward. It's our best rate of return capital dollars spent in the business. And so, we work very closely with our carriers to be able to maximize that category of capex.\nJon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you, very much.\nRod Smith -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer\nAnd Jonathan, I'll just give you a few numbers here to support Tom's comment. So of the 5,500, India is going to be the lion's share of that probably close to 3,500. In Latin America maybe around 500. In Africa, you can think of that as about 1,300 hundred or so in that range in a handful in Europe, maybe 40 in Europe and in a small number in the U.S.\nJon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks, so much.\nOperator\nNext, we have a question from Tim Long with Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nTim Long -- Barclays -- Analyst\nThank you. Thank you. Just one quick clarification if I could and then a question. I just want to make sure I heard it right as far as not to kill the team of Sprint MLA here.\nBut it is the comment that this is likely going to be a four-year period. I think I heard that. And then second, I'm just interested in talking a little bit about Europe. Obviously, still pretty small but a few hundred, 200 acquired sites there.\nCould you give a little more color on that, and maybe update us on views there with the MLA landscape is obviously still a lot of activity in the European theatre.

Just how large is that addressable market? And how quickly do you expect it to ramp?\nBob Patterson -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So I think it's going to -- well, first of all, for -- 5G is going to take place -- there's going to be a global pull for it. I would say that -- I probably talked about this on our last call and my recent visit to China where you can just see towers going up on every other corner and block. So they're going to be a leader in terms of getting out there and actually getting an install base.\nI think that what you'll see is actually something that probably looks similar to how other generations have expanded. So even if you look at 4G right now or the predecessor technologies, they don't encompass the entire United States, if I pick the U.S., for example, right, there is still plenty of places that don't have access to the latest technology. So one of the things that I like most about 5G is that this is a multiyear growth opportunity for this business and for our segment. It's not something that's going to happen in one year.\nAnd I really believe it will take place over the course of 12 or 15 years. But be a very solid and steady double-digit grower for us. So that's how to put that in perspective. Notwithstanding just kind of all the noise around Huawei and all that stuff that's going on right now.\nTechnology is going to move forward, right? And people are going to put this in if they perceive it's better. And so I don't see that changing as time moves on.\nJim Sheehan -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst\nAnd regarding performance, products and solutions. How are you evaluating your strategic options for that business at this point in time?\nBob Patterson -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nI don't think there is anything different to say about that with respect to how we think about our portfolio. So no new news.\nJim Sheehan -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst\nAnd on that segment, would you say that second quarter represented just the catch up from maybe business that was lost due to weather in the first quarter? Or how sustainable are your second-quarter results in PP&amp;S?\nBob Patterson -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean I think there is certainly -- first of all, yes, you're right in pointing out that the first quarter was very difficult just in terms of how things started off with -- from a weather impact in the construction space. So I think there is some pick up. Year over year, I'd still say construction is down. And as a result of that you see the PP&amp;S segment impacted by it.\nBut much better than what we saw in the first quarter. And I believe that's sustainable. So my sense is that if you just want to put things into perspective here for the balance of the year, you'll see some traditional seasonality with respect to Q3 and Q4. But I'm not expecting anything else beyond that.\nSo my view of where we're at is quite sustainable.\nJim Sheehan -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you.

For the operating expenses, it will be growing along with our enlarged revenue. However, as a percentage of revenue, we hope it will be flat to down, under control. So the revenue growth will outpace the operating expenses. As for raw material like raw wafer and also labors that were also on the rise. But altogether, I think we are commenting that because of our production efficiency improvement, our improved economy of scale, and also with a good outlook for both demand as well as pricing for 2022. I think there's still further upside for our margins -- profit margins.\nCharlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot you. Thank you that's super helpful. Thanks gentlemen.\nOperator\nThe next question is coming from Roland Shu of Citigroup. Go ahead please.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. So your Xiamen fab began production from 4Q 2015. It was still loss-making last year, and I think it is still loss-making now. So with the better pricing, when do you expect Xiamen fab is going to be turned around? And also how many margin upside or earning upside to UMC once Xiamen fab is breakeven?\nQi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary\nXiamen should be able to be profitable in 2022. As a matter of fact, they are profitable in single quarters of 2021. So we are very close to breakeven in 2021. And it is expected to be profitable in 2022. However, it will still below corporate average in terms of profit margin in 2022. And there's still room for Xiamen to catch up to the level of UMC's corporate average.\nRoland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Yes. Do you have the time frame of when this Xiamen fab gross margin is going to approach corporate average?\nQi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary\nNo, we don't have a time frame. We -- all we can say is I can give you a rough comparison. Currently, our Singapore fab has higher gross margin than corporate average. And the Japan fab is catching up to almost identical to the UMC corporate average. And the Xiamen is, as I mentioned, coming out of loss-making to nearly breakeven this year.

Consistent with our prior Q3 calls, my comments today will center on the key trends driving our business now and how we think the technological landscape will develop in the future. I'll touch on how we are positioned to benefit as 5G deployments accelerate in cloud-native applications in the edge of all, particularly in the United States.\nAdditionally, I'll spend some time discussing our European markets, where we now have a scaled presence and are poised to create further value as technology evolves there, and then briefly cover what we are seeing in our earlier-stage international markets. Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets and the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future. At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations.\nIn the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue to drive, our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we are excited about and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term. Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future, as macro towers should remain the most cost and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide.\nOur conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless capex spending in markets like the United States, and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally. We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the two and a half gig band currently being deployed in the U.S., as the workhorse of the true 5G experience, and we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of the sub-6 gig frequencies, compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multiyear period of strong growth on our tower sites. We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S.\ntoday, generating record services revenues, driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments. Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless capex spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years, driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next five years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last five years, and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade.\nThis compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term noncancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog, gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027, and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that s&quot;},&quot;q&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-Q3&quot;},&quot;ticker&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;AMT&quot;},&quot;predictions&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;class_id&quot;:0,&quot;class_name&quot;:&quot;correct&quot;,&quot;prob&quot;:0.7707838125720261},{&quot;class_id&quot;:1,&quot;class_name&quot;:&quot;incorrect&quot;,&quot;prob&quot;:0.22921618742797387}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;class_id\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;class_name\&quot;: \&quot;correct\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prob\&quot;: 0.7707838125720261\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;class_id\&quot;: 1,\n    \&quot;class_name\&quot;: \&quot;incorrect\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prob\&quot;: 0.22921618742797387\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the expected growth rate for tenant billings abroad through 2027 &quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; The expected growth rate for tenant billings abroad through 2027 is not explicitly stated in the transcript.

Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of the sub-6 gig frequencies, compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multiyear period of strong growth on our tower sites. We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S.\ntoday, generating record services revenues, driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments. Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless capex spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years, driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next five years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last five years, and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade.\nThis compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term noncancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog, gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027, and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that s&quot;},&quot;q&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-Q3&quot;},&quot;ticker&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;AMT&quot;},&quot;predictions&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;class_id&quot;:0,&quot;class_name&quot;:&quot;correct&quot;,&quot;prob&quot;:0.7707838125720261},{&quot;class_id&quot;:1,&quot;class_name&quot;:&quot;incorrect&quot;,&quot;prob&quot;:0.22921618742797387}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;class_id\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;class_name\&quot;: \&quot;correct\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prob\&quot;: 0.7707838125720261\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;class_id\&quot;: 1,\n    \&quot;class_name\&quot;: \&quot;incorrect\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prob\&quot;: 0.22921618742797387\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the expected growth rate for the foundry/logic market in 2021 &quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; The expected growth rate for the foundry/logic market in 2021 is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it is mentioned that the foundry/logic market is expected to be the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market in 2021, with strong investments in both leading edge and specialty devices.&quot;},&quot;date&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;May 20, 2021, 4:30 p.m. ET&quot;},&quot;transcript&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;built from customized and entirely new types of silicon. Third, the benefits of traditional Moore's Law 2D scaling are slowing down, and the semiconductor industry is transitioning to a new playbook to drive power, performance, area, cost, and time to market. As the PPACt playbook is adopted, it is driving a step-up in investments across the ecosystem. Fourth, there's an increased focus on ensuring that growth is sustainable and responsible as the industry scales, and advancing energy-efficient computing is critical.\nAnd fifth, there's a business model inflection as companies migrate away from products and transactions to outcomes and deeper collaborations focused on speed and time to market. These five factors add up to strong and strengthening demand for wafer fab equipment and advanced services that we believe is sustainable well beyond 2021. For the first time, customers are providing capital spending guidance for multiple years into the future, which is a new leading indicator for demand sustainability. In 2021, we expect foundry/logic to be the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market with strong investments in both leading edge and specialty devices.\nDRAM is the next fastest-growing market, with all major DRAM manufacturers investing in new technology and capacity. Finally, we see NAND growing at a more modest rate this year on the back of about 30% growth in calendar 2020. More importantly, Applied is outperforming the overall market. Recent VLSI market data confirmed that our semi-equipment business grew 23% in 2020 versus market growth of less than 19%.\nWe outperformed even though the device mix would not typically be considered favorable for Applied. There are several reasons why I'm confident 2021 will be another strong year of outperformance. To start with, our leadership areas are in the fastest-growing parts of the market. We expect CMP epithermal implant to all grow more than 50% this year.\nNext, we're very well-positioned to serve the fast-growing specialty markets. We anticipated this market growth several years ago and formed a new group inside the company called ICAPS to focus on IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor applications. In addition, we have strong traction with new products, especially in areas where we have space to grow share. In 2020, we gained 240 basis points of market share in conductor etch and 220 basis points in CVD, thanks to the momentum we have in patterning applications for DRAM and foundry/logic.\nThis year, our etch and CVD businesses combined will generate more than $7.5 billion of revenue. In process diagnostics and control, we expect to grow around 50% in 2021 and generate more than $900 million of revenue from our e-beam products. Extending our leadership in e-beam has been a major focus as it is a highly strategic capability that accelerates adoption of our differentiated semi products in integrated material solutions, as well as being a key component of our actionable insight accelerator. Finally, we're seeing increasing adoption of our integrated solutions where we're bringing together unique combinations of technologies and capabilities.\nIn 2021, we expect to generate more than $400 million of revenue from our first Integrated Material Solutions. In addition, revenues from our advanced packaging product portfolio are on track to exceed $800 million, almost doubling since 2019. Looking beyond the strength in our business today, we believe we're in a great position to deliver sustainable outperformance over multiple years. As the industry roadmap transitions from traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling to the new PPACt playbook, materials engineering becomes critically enabling.\nThis is because significant PPACt innovations in transistor and interconnect, structures, and materials are taking place and these innovations are enabled by Applied's leadership technologies. We'll cover this topic in more detail at our upcoming logic masterclass. As we described at our investor meeting, to serve our customers' evolving needs and maximize our growth opportunities, we'v&quot;},&quot;q&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;2021-Q2&quot;},&quot;ticker&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;AMAT&quot;},&quot;predictions&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;list like&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:[{&quot;class_id&quot;:0,&quot;class_name&quot;:&quot;correct&quot;,&quot;prob&quot;:0.7703285967172204},{&quot;class_id&quot;:1,&quot;class_name&quot;:&quot;incorrect&quot;,&quot;prob&quot;:0.22967140328277955}],&quot;string&quot;:&quot;[\n  {\n    \&quot;class_id\&quot;: 0,\n    \&quot;class_name\&quot;: \&quot;correct\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prob\&quot;: 0.7703285967172204\n  },\n  {\n    \&quot;class_id\&quot;: 1,\n    \&quot;class_name\&quot;: \&quot;incorrect\&quot;,\n    \&quot;prob\&quot;: 0.22967140328277955\n  }\n]&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:40,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;What is the expected growth rate for the DRAM market in 2021 &quot;},&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; The expected growth rate for the DRAM market in 2021 is not explicitly stated in the transcript.

While the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry mega trend of 5G and HPC-related applications.

As a result, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 as we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand for our advanced and specialty technologies. Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook and profitability.
We are entering a period of higher structural growth. As the technology becomes more pervasive and essential in people's lives, and the digital transformation accelerates, the semiconductor industry value in supply chain is increasing. As we embark upon the 5G era, an intelligent and more connected world will fuel a massive requirement for computation power and prepare greater need for energy-efficient computing, which demand greater use of leading-edge technologies. The multiyear mega trend of 5G and HPC-related applications will drive multiunit volume growth and more importantly, spur substantial semiconductor content enrichment in HPC, smartphone, automotive, and IoT applications to address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile.
TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technology to support their group demand. At the same time, we are committed to achieve a sustainable and proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Over the last three years, we have raised our capex spending from USD 14.9 billion in 2019 to USD 30 billion in 2021 as we invest in anticipation of the growth that will follow. During the same period, our revenue in US dollar term has increased from USD 34.6 billion in 2019 to USD 56.8 billion in 2021 or 1.6 times and our EPS by 1.7 times.
Looking ahead, as the world's largest reliable and effective capacity provider with our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well-positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry mega trend with our differentiated technologies. We expect our long-term revenue to be between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in US dollar terms, of course, fueled by all four growth platform which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. With the increasing need for computation, HPC will be the strongest driver of TSMC's long-term growth and expect it to be the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth with the CPU, GPU, and AI accelerators are the main growth area for our HPC platform. As we invest in leading-edge and specialty technology to support our customers' demand, we continue to face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading-edge node, new investment in mature node, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint, and rising materials and basic commodity cost.
We are continuing to work closely with our customer to support their growth, and our pricing strategy will remain strategic not optimistic to reflect our value creation. We will also work diligently in our own fab operation and with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe our long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable, and we can earn a sustainable and proper return of greater than 25% ROE through that cycle.

We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.
We expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.
As we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.
Now, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.

							</td><td class="min-w-fit max-w-sm break-words p-2 "><div class="line-clamp-2 "><div class="" dir="auto">g demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.
We expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.
As we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.
Now, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.

And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.
Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.
5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.
We are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.
dollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.
As a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.
We are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.
We have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.
N3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, l</div></div>

And our business to be less volatile, they're more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.
Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.
5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's capex and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors.
We are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S.
dollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our capex and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.
As a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.
We are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.
We have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.
N3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, l</div></div>

We are talking about 5G now and others, a lot of people talk about 6G, too.

[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Wanted to talk about 3D Sensing. Typically, September quarter is the strongest, but there's some belief that some of this demand will be slipping into the December quarter. Is that your perception?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, go ahead, Giovanni.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President
I'm sorry, you were talking about the 3D Sensing?
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Yes. Typically, September is strongest, but some of that now might be shifting more into December than traditionally?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President
I don't know, I don't see that. But we have a multiple design wins that are ramping. And so I don't believe there will be any particular pattern of shipments and so forth other than maybe what we experienced in the past. I think some of the designs will balance with each other in terms of the demand and the pull in.
So I think it will be I would expect a similar ramp and the similar demand that we've seen in the past. I think volume-wise, for us, we expect, as we said, we expect to continue to gain share over time. We have been doing it, as you can validate with the growth rates we have reported quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Obviously, we are growing much faster than market, much, much faster than that.
So we expect that, that is an indication of a share gain, and we continue to do that.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Let me just add to that before we finish up, and Mark, I'll give you your follow-up. But at least for the last two years for our company, maybe for all the years we've shipped, the 12/31 quarter has consistently been stronger than 9/30. So that's what made Q3 and Q4 3/31 and 6/30 being higher than the 12/31 kind of remarkable. But generally speaking, we have not actually seen all the shipments going out in 9/30 quarter.
Sorry, Mark, go ahead.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Last question for me is ROADM, I assume that was strong. Any color on that?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So yes, so go ahead, Giovanni.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President
Yes. Yes, absolutely. ROADM is an integral part of out in traffic at the fiscal layer, as you know. And as I said, the new network architectures out there that require way more flexibility to provision traffic at the right place at the right time, really increased the demand for the kind of products versus the previous network architecture.
So it has been very strong for us.

But I encourage you to look at the at the 6G white paper published by Samsung, which is publicly available and to get a flavor on how the entire world is already moving to the next step. So when you talk about the cycle, the cycles on next-generation wireless connectivity hasn't really finished the 4G yet.
We are talking about 5G now and others, a lot of people talk about 6G, too. So it's not going to end quickly because the need for connectivity increases and continues to increase and drive the new requirements that need new solutions. And so there will be ups and downs, of course, over time. But I think the much denser type of network connectivity that is required by the 5G infrastructure, I think, will require volume deployments that we haven't obviously experienced in the past.
And of course, with that, all the data storage increase in worldwide will also require an increased level of connectivity that it just wasn't there in the past. So I think the demand will be very healthy for quite some time.
Chris Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Thank you guys.

[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Wanted to talk about 3D Sensing. Typically, September quarter is the strongest, but there's some belief that some of this demand will be slipping into the December quarter. Is that your perception?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, go ahead, Giovanni.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President
I'm sorry, you were talking about the 3D Sensing?
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Yes. Typically, September is strongest, but some of that now might be shifting more into December than traditionally?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President
I don't know, I don't see that. But we have a multiple design wins that are ramping. And so I don't believe there will be any particular pattern of shipments and so forth other than maybe what we experienced in the past. I think some of the designs will balance with each other in terms of the demand and the pull in.
So I think it will be I would expect a similar ramp and the similar demand that we've seen in the past. I think volume-wise, for us, we expect, as we said, we expect to continue to gain share over time. We have been doing it, as you can validate with the growth rates we have reported quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Obviously, we are growing much faster than market, much, much faster than that.
So we expect that, that is an indication of a share gain, and we continue to do that.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Let me just add to that before we finish up, and Mark, I'll give you your follow-up. But at least for the last two years for our company, maybe for all the years we've shipped, the 12/31 quarter has consistently been stronger than 9/30. So that's what made Q3 and Q4 3/31 and 6/30 being higher than the 12/31 kind of remarkable. But generally speaking, we have not actually seen all the shipments going out in 9/30 quarter.
Sorry, Mark, go ahead.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Last question for me is ROADM, I assume that was strong. Any color on that?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So yes, so go ahead, Giovanni.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and the President
Yes. Yes, absolutely. ROADM is an integral part of out in traffic at the fiscal layer, as you know. And as I said, the new network architectures out there that require way more flexibility to provision traffic at the right place at the right time, really increased the demand for the kind of products versus the previous network architecture.
So it has been very strong for us.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Thank you.

We are excited to see our 5G business continuing to flourish and are looking forward to broader deployment of 5G in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and India.
In addition, we anticipate significant share in content growth ahead and new opportunities in ORAN and DRAM architectures. As you will recall, in March 2020, Nokia and Marvell announced that our companies have started working together to develop a leading 5G silicon including multiple generations of custom silicon and infrastructure processors to further expand the range of Nokia's ReefShark chipsets. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our collaboration with Nokia to further advance their 5G chipset portfolio. Nokia will be using our new OCTEON 10 DPU, the industry's leading 5G transport processor built on Marvell's cutting-edge five-nanometer platform and hardware acceleration technology.
These high-performance and highly efficient processors will allow operators to scale rapidly and manage the dramatic increase in data traffic and performance demanded by 5G's innovative service-based architecture while reducing cost and energy consumption. We continue to expand our collaboration with Nokia and look forward to enabling their next-generation 5G platforms. There are also two key announcements from the Open RAN ecosystem. Vodafone and Nokia announced that they have agreed to work on a fully compliant Open RAN solution with Marvell.
Developing cooperation with us, Nokia's ReefShark SoC boosts Layer-1 processing capability to enable Open RAN systems to reach full functionality and performance parity with traditional mobile radio networks. In another development, Vodafone and Samsung recently announced that they are jointly cooperating with Marvell to accelerate the performance and adoption of 5G Open RAN across Europe. They plan on incorporating Marvell's advanced OCTEON Fusion processor specifically designed for Open RAN into the latest off-the-shelf servers. The specialized accelerator chip also enables massive MIMO technology developed to serve many subscribers in dense urban areas.
Moving on to our outlook for next quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from our carrier end market to grow slightly on a sequential basis and grow year over year approximately in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $376 million, growing 52% year over year and 10% sequentially.
As the quarter progressed, our Chinese customers started to turn cautious due to an evolving macroeconomic environment. In response, we work with customers realigning shipments to reflect their reduced demand. As a result, despite the strong sequential and year-over-year growth, revenue was lower than our guidance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from the enterprise networking end market to decline sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis.
However, we expect growth to continue year over year at close to 40%, reflecting our higher content and growing share. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, growing 26% year over year and 1% sequentially. Revenue was lower than our forecast in industrial, as well as automotive where we continue to experience supply challenges in certain legacy notes.
We expect these supply challenges to start to improve in our fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our auto business continued to grow, partially offset by a decline in our industrial business. On a year-over-year basis in this end market, Marvell's growth was primarily from our auto business, driven by continuing adoption of our Ethernet technology. Our auto business achieved another milestone in the third quarter with annualized revenues exceeding $200 million.

Turning to our licensing business. Our second-quarter results reflect the strength of our unmatched patent portfolio value. We are the global 5G IP leader with more than 130 5G license agreements signed to date, up from over 120 last quarter with all major handset manufacturers around the globe licensed.
We continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G, which we expect to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its impact on multiple industries. We believe that our model of early research and development, consistent standards leadership, flexible licensing, and global implementation support will continue to add value to our partners and stockholders for years to come. Overall, we continue to see unprecedented demand across all of our technologies and businesses as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. Despite the industrywide semiconductor supply shortage, we're utilizing our scale and working across our entire global supply chain to maximize our ability to capture this opportunity.
We expect material improvements by the end of the calendar year due to planned capacity builds and multi-sourcing initiatives. As one of the leading drivers of advanced semiconductor technology platforms, we're also excited to see more foundry investment in the United States consistent with the United States government's strategic priorities. Finally, we're extremely proud of our collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Ingenuity, the Mars helicopter powered by Snapdragon. Snapdragon made it to Mars and helped power the first-ever autonomous flight on another planet.

Akash Palkhiwala -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong second-quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 52% and 116% in revenue and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT. In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74%, both above the high end of our guidance range.
The outperformance was primarily driven by stronger handset shipments, especially in China. In addition, our results include a benefit of approximately $80 million from adjustments to prior-quarter royalty estimates. In QCT, we delivered revenues of $6.3 billion and EBT of $1.6 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 53% while EBT grew 137%, delivering on our commitment to increase operating leverage.
We achieved the high end of our guidance range with EBT margins of 25%. This reflects our strong operating performance driven by favorable product mix and gross margins, which more than offset a reduction in the orders within the quarter by a global handset OEM. RF front-end revenues increased 39% year over year to approximately $900 million on the strength of our product portfolio across 4G, 5G sub-6, and 5G millimeter wave. 5G millimeter wave products accounted for less than 20% of our second-quarter RF front-end revenues.
We expect millimeter wave deployments in other regions, such as China, to be a tailwind for long-term revenue growth. Automotive revenues of $240 million grew 40%, and IoT revenues of $1.1 billion grew 71% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see strong momentum for our differentiated product portfolio. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of NUVIA for a purchase price of $1.4 billion before working capital and other adjustmen</div></div>

We believe that our model of early research and development, consistent standards leadership, flexible licensing, and global implementation support will continue to add value to our partners and stockholders for years to come. Overall, we continue to see unprecedented demand across all of our technologies and businesses as the current environment is accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. Despite the industrywide semiconductor supply shortage, we're utilizing our scale and working across our entire global supply chain to maximize our ability to capture this opportunity.
We expect material improvements by the end of the calendar year due to planned capacity builds and multi-sourcing initiatives. As one of the leading drivers of advanced semiconductor technology platforms, we're also excited to see more foundry investment in the United States consistent with the United States government's strategic priorities. Finally, we're extremely proud of our collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Ingenuity, the Mars helicopter powered by Snapdragon. Snapdragon made it to Mars and helped power the first-ever autonomous flight on another planet.
This is yet another example of our ingenuity. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.

Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong second-quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $7.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, which was $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 52% and 116% in revenue and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QTL and QCT. In QTL, we recorded revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 74%, both above the high end of our guidance range.
The outperformance was primarily driven by stronger handset shipments, especially in China. In addition, our results include a benefit of approximately $80 million from adjustments to prior-quarter royalty estimates. In QCT, we delivered revenues of $6.3 billion and EBT of $1.6 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 53% while EBT grew 137%, delivering on our commitment to increase operating leverage.
We achieved the high end of our guidance range with EBT margins of 25%. This reflects our strong operating performance driven by favorable product mix and gross margins, which more than offset a reduction in the orders within the quarter by a global handset OEM. RF front-end revenues increased 39% year over year to approximately $900 million on the strength of our product portfolio across 4G, 5G sub-6, and 5G millimeter wave. 5G millimeter wave products accounted for less than 20% of our second-quarter RF front-end revenues.
We expect millimeter wave deployments in other regions, such as China, to be a tailwind for long-term revenue growth. Automotive revenues of $240 million grew 40%, and IoT revenues of $1.1 billion grew 71% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see strong momentum for our differentiated product portfolio. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of NUVIA for a purchase price of $1.4 billion before working capital and other adjustmen</div></div>

OK. As my follow-up, I wanted to -- I want to ask you about content growth at your lead customer, but I know you won't go there. But I was hoping maybe you can give us a little more detail on sort of the frequency band support that will be needed as we move from one 5G phone to the next generation. In other words, the cycles within the cycle, so to speak, as it relates to their interfaces.
What sort of content growth do you think you can see long term and broad market related as these flagship phones need to support more frequency bands, in particular, things like millimeter wave support. And then, related to that, perhaps what your current stance is with respect to millimeter wave?
Liam Griffin -- Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President
Sure. Well, I mean, as you've seen, the frequency opportunities continue to expand. If you look at the C-band auction, for example, that opened up a tremendous amount of technology, three to six gig, where we can capitalize immediately. I think the appetite -- if we go high level, the appetite for this technology is really strong, right? The mobile technology that we see every year gets more complex, more challenging, whether it's in China, whether it's in the US, and we love that because we're a company that focuses on the high end, we focus on technology, we focus on excellence in our products and we see that opportunity be rewarded with our customers.
So we can hit all of those nodes, whether it's a China play, whether it's the high end of the US, and we've grown the technology along with it. So that's how we go to market. There's nothing new about the news around Huawei or anything like that, all that stuff is completely understood. Millimeter wave, you mentioned.
Millimeter wave is an interesting technology. It works in certain areas. It has some drawbacks as well that are well known. And we listen to our customers, and we have great engagement with all the players that we need to work with.
And together, we resolve the complexity and work on the end market solution. So we have investments across that entire spectrum. We know what we need to do to win. We also know what we need to do to allow our customers to win.
And that's the recipe that's been working.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. I just want to revisit the September guide. So I guess when you look at it on an organic basis, it's a little over $100 million sequentially. If you look back last year, your lead customer kind of contributed to that amount.
And with the earlier launch and content gains, we should think it would be more. So just trying to understand, are there some segments that are down? Or are you adding some conservatism? Just trying to understand with the acquisition, I know it's a great sequential, but just from looking at the moving pieces, should be a bit more in my mind. So just trying to figure out what I'm missing.
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
No, Blayne, I think as we indicated, it's -- organically, we see double-digit sequential growth into September, both in our mobile and broad markets business. And we have really done well and executed well on the design win side. We have higher content in multiple phones at all OEMs that are launching, and that will be launched here in the next couple of months or so. And so, it -- sometimes, it becomes a little bit of a unit play.
So we -- as you know, we always are somewhat conservative in our unit assumptions. There is definitely strong demand for the products. We do take into account, as Liam earlier expressed, some of the global supply issues which are there, right? And we need 100 parts to make a phone. If there are only 95, including this Skyworks parts, but there are missing some other parts from somebod</div></div>

We see signs that this evolution will start building at a larger scale through the end of 2021 and then go through 2022 and 2023.
The exact timetable might be impacted by COVID but we believe this is the general direction. The U.S. has been deploying 5G since late 2019 and shares leadership of the transition today with China. Network build-outs using wireless hauling for transport across networks have recently begun.
We've increased our 5G design wins to nine this quarter and we are participating in numerous 5G proofs of concepts and initial rollouts in the U.S., Europe, and the Pacific Rim. And plans are being finalized for mass rollouts. We anticipate that the first large-scale networks to make use of wireless hauling en masse are likely to pick off toward the end of 2021 and then to pick up speed at first gradually through 2022 and 2023.

Thank you, Ira, and good morning, everyone. To help you understand the results, I will be referring mainly to non-GAAP numbers. For more information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliations of these measures, we refer you to today's press release. During the fourth quarter, we made further progress moving back toward normal operations, continuing the positive trend that began in Q3 2020.
Our revenues returned to a strong level and at the high end of our projections for the quarter, as well as high end of our normal quarterly revenue run rate range pre-COVID. The reflected return through strong execution of almost all our ongoing activities in an industry, the thrills in new urgency for network building. At the same time, COVID has increased our supply chain expenses significantly, reducing our gross margin. These, compounded with the large technology write off and some indirect expenses for COVID in the quarter, gave us a low gross margin and took us into a net loss for the quarter despite the strong revenues.
Nevertheless, our financial performance in the fourth quarter remains strong with strong collections enabling us to generate $9.3 million in cash flow from operating and investing activities and to repay almost $12 billion in loans. Nevertheless, our financial performance in the fourth quarter remains strong with strong collections, enabling us to generate $9.3 million in cash flow from operating and investing activities and to repay almost $12 million in loans. In fact, all main balance sheet indicators, DSO, inventory, short-term loans, and cash flow moved in the right direction this quarter despite the very challenging environment. Let me now review the actual numbers with you.
Revenues for the fourth quarter were $74 million, up 5% compared with the third-quarter 2020, and up 4% compared with Q4 last year. The revenues varied from region to region in line with the effect that COVID has had on local business operations and network buildout plans. Europe had its strongest quarter in the last three years, reflecting </div></div>

Tom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean, I think we have. I mean to give the one. I mean India was up a bit. We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there.
So there's an outsized, probably piece of that 500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria markets, like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets where we're seeing upticks in the overall bill to suit the activity.
Brazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today. I think to be able to meet the demand and provide a good quality signal, and so we're seeing increased demand for site builds in Brazil as well. So it's a bit of a mixed across the three of them I'd say.
And I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to see continued increases in rates that built the suits going forward. It's our best rate of return capital dollars spent in the business. And so, we work very closely with our carriers to be able to maximize that category of capex.

And Jonathan, I'll just give you a few numbers here to support Tom's comment. So of the 5,500, India is going to be the lion's share of that probably close to 3,500. In Latin America maybe around 500. In Africa, you can think of that as about 1,300 hundred or so in that range in a handful in Europe, maybe 40 in Europe and in a small number in the U.S.

But it is the comment that this is likely going to be a four-year period. I think I heard that. And then second, I'm just interested in talking a little bit about Europe. Obviously, still pretty small but a few hundred, 200 acquired sites there.

Internationally, in each of the markets we -- just in terms of guidance for 2020, I mean all of the markets are up from a revenue perspective. As I mentioned before they're significant densification efforts going on in all of the markets. You can always go market by market and look at various metrics, and you can do -- you can see that there is a significant new infrastructure that needs to be added. New sites need to be added in those markets to be able to support the growth that they have going on in those markets.
And so, as we've always said, as you well know, the international markets are a couple of technologies behind generally. And so -- and without any really strong wireline capability and so on. And a pandemic even the market to the world that we're living in today there's even more of a demand for wireless infrastructure in those markets. And so, I think all of that gives a good backdrop for what we would expect growth to look like in the, Internationally in those markets.
We've always said it's going to be two basis points to 300 basis points faster than we're seeing in the United States. And if you take a look at even in Q3, you look at Latin America, you look at Africa they're all up in 7% to 8% range. And so, it's -- the model works. I think the strategy works and we're very bullish in terms of what we're expecting to see in our international markets over the next several years.

The 5,500 deals that upsized our outlook that you gave us to any kind of a regional pick out that you could provide.
Tom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean, I think we have. I mean to give the one. I mean India was up a bit. We've seen continued growth in the India marketplace from a couple of the large carriers there.
So there's an outsized, probably piece of that 500 that is there. And as Rod mentioned, we're getting double-digit rates of return right out of the gate. We're seeing also significant demand in Africa. In Nigeria markets, like Nigeria, Uganda, some of the markets where we're seeing upticks in the overall bill to suit the activity.
Brazil is a market we've always talked about. It's been indeed probably twice as many sites in the market as they are today. I think to be able to meet the demand and provide a good quality signal, and so we're seeing increased demand for site builds in Brazil as well. So it's a bit of a mixed across the three of them I'd say.
And I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to see continued increases in rates that built the suits going forward. It's our best rate of return capital dollars spent in the business. And so, we work very closely with our carriers to be able to maximize that category of capex.
Jon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you, very much.
Rod Smith -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer
And Jonathan, I'll just give you a few numbers here to support Tom's comment. So of the 5,500, India is going to be the lion's share of that probably close to 3,500. In Latin America maybe around 500. In Africa, you can think of that as about 1,300 hundred or so in that range in a handful in Europe, maybe 40 in Europe and in a small number in the U.S.
Jon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Tim Long -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thank you. Thank you. Just one quick clarification if I could and then a question. I just want to make sure I heard it right as far as not to kill the team of Sprint MLA here.
But it is the comment that this is likely going to be a four-year period. I think I heard that. And then second, I'm just interested in talking a little bit about Europe. Obviously, still pretty small but a few hundred, 200 acquired sites there.
Could you give a little more color on that, and maybe update us on views there with the MLA landscape is obviously still a lot of activity in the European theatre. And you guys are underrepresented. </div></div>

Jim Sheehan -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst
Thanks. Good morning. Could you provide a little more detail on how you're reviewing the 5G opportunity? Just how large is that addressable market? And how quickly do you expect it to ramp?
Bob Patterson -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So I think it's going to -- well, first of all, for -- 5G is going to take place -- there's going to be a global pull for it. I would say that -- I probably talked about this on our last call and my recent visit to China where you can just see towers going up on every other corner and block. So they're going to be a leader in terms of getting out there and actually getting an install base.
I think that what you'll see is actually something that probably looks similar to how other generations have expanded. So even if you look at 4G right now or the predecessor technologies, they don't encompass the entire United States, if I pick the U.S., for example, right, there is still plenty of places that don't have access to the latest technology. So one of the things that I like most about 5G is that this is a multiyear growth opportunity for this business and for our segment. It's not something that's going to happen in one year.
And I really believe it will take place over the course of 12 or 15 years. But be a very solid and steady double-digit grower for us. So that's how to put that in perspective. Notwithstanding just kind of all the noise around Huawei and all that stuff that's going on right now.
Technology is going to move forward, right? And people are going to put this in if they perceive it's better. And so I don't see that changing as time moves on.
Jim Sheehan -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst
And regarding performance, products and solutions. How are you evaluating your strategic options for that business at this point in time?
Bob Patterson -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
I don't think there is anything different to say about that with respect to how we think about our portfolio. So no new news.
Jim Sheehan -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst
And on that segment, would you say that second quarter represented just the catch up from maybe business that was lost due to weather in the first quarter? Or how sustainable are your second-quarter results in PP&amp;S?
Bob Patterson -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean I think there is certainly -- first of all, yes, you're right in pointing out that the first quarter was very difficult just in terms of how things started off with -- from a weather impact in the construction space. So I think there is some pick up. Year over year, I'd still say construction is down. And as a result of that you see the PP&amp;S segment impacted by it.
But much better than what we saw in the first quarter. And I believe that's sustainable. So my sense is that if you just want to put things into perspective here for the balance of the year, you'll see some traditional seasonality with respect to Q3 and Q4. But I'm not expecting anything else beyond that.
So my view of where we're at is quite sustainable.

Yes. But the consensus for TSMC is like next year to grow 15% to 20%. So do you think you can perform similar or even better than this key foundry peer?
Jason Wang -- Director and President
Our estimate on the foundry industry growth in 2022 at this point is about 12%.

12%. I'm sorry. Okay.
Jason Wang -- Director and President
12%. Yes. And for our business outlook, I think we'll be higher than this current foundry industry projection.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Okay. And lastly, variable cost. I mean that is a key reason why foundry peers want to hike the price, right? So variable cost no matter percentage or per wafer number. So can Chitung give us some kind of comment about the trend? For example, this year-over-year, what was the growth for the variable cost? And what would be the variable cost growth for the coming two years?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
Yes. For the operating expenses, it will be growing along with our enlarged revenue. However, as a percentage of revenue, we hope it will be flat to down, under control. So the revenue growth will outpace the operating expenses. As for raw material like raw wafer and also labors that were also on the rise. But altogether, I think we are commenting that because of our production efficiency improvement, our improved economy of scale, and also with a good outlook for both demand as well as pricing for 2022. I think there's still further upside for our margins -- profit margins.

The next question is coming from Roland Shu of Citigroup. Go ahead please.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Good afternoon. So your Xiamen fab began production from 4Q 2015. It was still loss-making last year, and I think it is still loss-making now. So with the better pricing, when do you expect Xiamen fab is going to be turned around? And also how many margin upside or earning upside to UMC once Xiamen fab is breakeven?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
Xiamen should be able to be profitable in 2022. As a matter of fact, they are profitable in single quarters of 2021. So we are very close to breakeven in 2021. And it is expected to be profitable in 2022. However, it will still below corporate average in terms of profit margin in 2022. And there's still room for Xiamen to catch up to the level of UMC's corporate average.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Understood. Yes. Do you have the time frame of when this Xiamen fab gross margin is going to approach corporate average?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
No, we don't have a time frame. We -- all we can say is I can give you a rough comparison. Currently, our Singapore fab has higher gross margin than corporate average. And the Japan fab is catching up to almost identical to the UMC corporate average. And the Xiamen is, as I mentioned, coming out of loss-making to nearly breakeven this year. And it will be profitable next year, but still away </div></div>

Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yes. But the consensus for TSMC is like next year to grow 15% to 20%. So do you think you can perform similar or even better than this key foundry peer?
Jason Wang -- Director and President
Our estimate on the foundry industry growth in 2022 at this point is about 12%.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
12%. I'm sorry. Okay.
Jason Wang -- Director and President
12%. Yes. And for our business outlook, I think we'll be higher than this current foundry industry projection.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Okay. And lastly, variable cost. I mean that is a key reason why foundry peers want to hike the price, right? So variable cost no matter percentage or per wafer number. So can Chitung give us some kind of comment about the trend? For example, this year-over-year, what was the growth for the variable cost? And what would be the variable cost growth for the coming two years?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
Yes. For the operating expenses, it will be growing along with our enlarged revenue. However, as a percentage of revenue, we hope it will be flat to down, under control. So the revenue growth will outpace the operating expenses. As for raw material like raw wafer and also labors that were also on the rise. But altogether, I think we are commenting that because of our production efficiency improvement, our improved economy of scale, and also with a good outlook for both demand as well as pricing for 2022. I think there's still further upside for our margins -- profit margins.

The next question is coming from Roland Shu of Citigroup. Go ahead please.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Good afternoon. So your Xiamen fab began production from 4Q 2015. It was still loss-making last year, and I think it is still loss-making now. So with the better pricing, when do you expect Xiamen fab is going to be turned around? And also how many margin upside or earning upside to UMC once Xiamen fab is breakeven?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
Xiamen should be able to be profitable in 2022. As a matter of fact, they are profitable in single quarters of 2021. So we are very close to breakeven in 2021. And it is expected to be profitable in 2022. However, it will still below corporate average in terms of profit margin in 2022. And there's still room for Xiamen to catch up to the level of UMC's corporate average.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Understood. Yes. Do you have the time frame of when this Xiamen fab gross margin is going to approach corporate average?
Qi Dong Liu -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Governance and Company Secretary
No, we don't have a time frame. We -- all we can say is I can give you a rough comparison. Currently, our Singapore fab has higher gross margin than corporate average. And the Japan fab is catching up to almost identical to the UMC corporate average. And the Xiamen is, as I mentioned, coming out of loss-making to nearly breakeven this year. And it will be profitable next year, but still away </div></div>

Tom Bartlett -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. Consistent with our prior Q3 calls, my comments today will center on the key trends driving our business now and how we think the technological landscape will develop in the future. I'll touch on how we are positioned to benefit as 5G deployments accelerate in cloud-native applications in the edge of all, particularly in the United States.
Additionally, I'll spend some time discussing our European markets, where we now have a scaled presence and are poised to create further value as technology evolves there, and then briefly cover what we are seeing in our earlier-stage international markets. Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets and the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future. At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations.
In the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue to drive, our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we are excited about and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term. Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future, as macro towers should remain the most cost and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide.
Our conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless capex spending in markets like the United States, and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally. We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the two and a half gig band currently being deployed in the U.S., as the workhorse of the true 5G experience, and we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of the sub-6 gig frequencies, compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multiyear period of strong growth on our tower sites. We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S.
today, generating record services revenues, driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments. Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless capex spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years, driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next five years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last five years, and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade.
This compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term noncancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog, gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027, and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that s</div></div>

Third, the benefits of traditional Moore's Law 2D scaling are slowing down, and the semiconductor industry is transitioning to a new playbook to drive power, performance, area, cost, and time to market. As the PPACt playbook is adopted, it is driving a step-up in investments across the ecosystem. Fourth, there's an increased focus on ensuring that growth is sustainable and responsible as the industry scales, and advancing energy-efficient computing is critical.
And fifth, there's a business model inflection as companies migrate away from products and transactions to outcomes and deeper collaborations focused on speed and time to market. These five factors add up to strong and strengthening demand for wafer fab equipment and advanced services that we believe is sustainable well beyond 2021. For the first time, customers are providing capital spending guidance for multiple years into the future, which is a new leading indicator for demand sustainability. In 2021, we expect foundry/logic to be the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market with strong investments in both leading edge and specialty devices.
DRAM is the next fastest-growing market, with all major DRAM manufacturers investing in new technology and capacity. Finally, we see NAND growing at a more modest rate this year on the back of about 30% growth in calendar 2020. More importantly, Applied is outperforming the overall market. Recent VLSI market data confirmed that our semi-equipment business grew 23% in 2020 versus market growth of less than 19%.
We outperformed even though the device mix would not typically be considered favorable for Applied. There are several reasons why I'm confident 2021 will be another strong year of outperformance. To start with, our leadership areas are in the fastest-growing parts of the market. We expect CMP epithermal implant to all grow more than 50% this year.
Next, we're very well-positioned to serve the fast-growing specialty markets. We anticipated this market growth several years ago and formed a new group inside the company called ICAPS to focus on IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor applications. In addition, we have strong traction with new products, especially in areas where we have space to grow share. In 2020, we gained 240 basis points of market share in conductor etch and 220 basis points in CVD, thanks to the momentum we have in patterning applications for DRAM and foundry/logic.
This year, our etch and CVD businesses combined will generate more than $7.5 billion of revenue. In process diagnostics and control, we expect to grow around 50% in 2021 and generate more than $900 million of revenue from our e-beam products. Extending our leadership in e-beam has been a major focus as it is a highly strategic capability that accelerates adoption of our differentiated semi products in integrated material solutions, as well as being a key component of our actionable insight accelerator. Finally, we're seeing increasing adoption of our integrated solutions where we're bringing together unique combinations of technologies and capabilities.
In 2021, we expect to generate more than $400 million of revenue from our first Integrated Material Solutions. In addition, revenues from our advanced packaging product portfolio are on track to exceed $800 million, almost doubling since 2019. Looking beyond the strength in our business today, we believe we're in a great position to deliver sustainable outperformance over multiple years. As the industry roadmap transitions from traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling to the new PPACt playbook, materials engineering becomes critically enabling.
This is because significant PPACt innovations in transistor and interconnect, structures, and materials are taking place and these innovations are enabled by Applied's leadership technologies. We'll cover this topic in more detail at our upcoming logic masterclass.
