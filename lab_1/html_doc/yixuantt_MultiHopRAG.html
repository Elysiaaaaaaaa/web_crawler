</h3>
<p><strong>MultiHop-RAG</strong>: a QA dataset to evaluate retrieval and reasoning across documents with metadata in the RAG pipelines. It contains 2556 queries, with evidence for each query distributed across 2 to 4 documents. The queries also involve document metadata, reflecting complex scenarios commonly found in real-world RAG applications.</p>
