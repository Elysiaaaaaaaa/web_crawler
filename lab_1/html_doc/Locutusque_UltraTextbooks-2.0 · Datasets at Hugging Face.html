It was designed for building large distributed and fault-tolerant Telecom applications. Today, Erlang is used in a variety of applications, including servers, distributed systems, and financial systems.\n\nIn this section, we will cover the basic syntax and data types in Erlang. Understanding the syntax and data types is crucial for writing correct and efficient Erlang code.\n\nErlang programs are written in a high-level declarative language. Compared to imperative programming languages like Java or C, Erlang programs are usually more concise and shorter in terms of coding lines. This makes Erlang a productive language for software development.\n\nOne of the key features of Erlang is its support for concurrency. Erlang uses a message passing paradigm, allowing lightweight concurrent processes to communicate with each other without the need to share memory. This makes Erlang well-suited for multi-core environments and offers a higher level of abstraction for synchronization compared to locking mechanisms used in other languages.\n\nAnother important feature of Erlang is its support for distribution. Erlang is designed to be run in a distributed environment, with an Erlang system consisting of a network of Erlang nodes. Processes running on different nodes can communicate with each other in the same way as processes on the same node.\n\nErlang also provides robustness through its exception detection and recovery mechanism. It supports catch/throw-style exceptions and offers a supervision feature, where a process can register as a supervisor for another process and receive notifications if the supervised process terminates. The supervisor can then restart the crashed process.\n\nIn the next few sections, we will dive deeper into the syntax and data types in Erlang, exploring how to write correct and efficient code.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple Erlang program that prints \&quot;Hello, World!\&quot; to the console:\n\n```erlang\n-module(hello_world).\n-export([start/0]).\n\nstart() ->\n    io:format(\&quot;Hello, World!~n\&quot;).\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a module called `hello_world` and export a function called `start`. The `start` function uses the `io:format` function to print the string \&quot;Hello, World!\&quot; to the console.\n\n## Exercise\nWrite an Erlang program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution\n```erlang\n-module(factorial).\n-export([calculate_factorial/1]).\n\ncalculate_factorial(0) ->\n    1;\ncalculate_factorial(N) ->\n    N * calculate_factorial(N-1).\n```\n\n# Understanding the principles of OTP design\n\nOTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of libraries and design principles that provide a framework for building fault-tolerant and scalable applications in Erlang. OTP is widely used in the Erlang community and has proven to be effective in building robust systems.\n\nIn this section, we will explore the principles of OTP design and how they can be applied to maximize Erlang performance. Understanding these principles is essential for developing efficient and reliable Erlang applications.\n\nA fundamental concept in OTP design is the supervision tree. The supervision tree is a hierarchical arrangement of code into supervisors and workers. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the behavior of workers and can restart them if something goes wrong. This hierarchical structure allows for the design and programming of fault-tolerant software.\n\nIn OTP, behaviors are formalizations of common patterns found in supervision trees. Behaviors divide the code for a process into a generic part (a behavior module) and a specific part (a callback module). The behavior module is part of Erlang/OTP and provides a set of pre-defined functions, while the callback module is implemented by the user and exports the necessary callback functions.\n\nLet's consider an example of a simple server in Erlang. The server keeps track of a number of \&quot;channels\&quot; and allows other processes to allocate and free these channels.\n\n```erlang\n-module(channel_server).\n-behavior(gen_server).\n\n-export([start_link/0]).\n-export([alloc/0, free/1]).\n\nstart_link() ->\n    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).\n\nalloc() ->\n    gen_server:call(?MODULE, alloc).\n\nfree(Channel) ->\n    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {free, Channel}).\n\ninit([]) ->\n    {ok, []}.\n\nhandle_call(alloc, _From, State) ->\n    {reply, {ok, Channel}, [Channel | State]}.\n\nhandle_cast({free, Channel}, State) ->\n    {noreply, lists:delete(Channel, State), State}.\n\nhandle_info(_Info, State) ->\n    {noreply, State}.\n\nterminate(_Reason, _State) ->\n    ok.\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a behavior module called `gen_server` and implement the necessary callback functions in the callback module. The server keeps track of the allocated channels in its state and responds to `alloc` and `free` requests from other processes.\n\n## Exercise\nConsider the example of the channel server. How would you modify the code to handle the case where all channels have been allocated and there are no available channels to allocate?\n\n### Solution\nYou can modify the `handle_call` function to check if there are any available channels before allocating a new one. If there are no available channels, you can reply with an error message instead.\n\n```erlang\nhandle_call(alloc, _From, State) ->\n    case available_channels(State) of\n        [] ->\n            {reply, {error, no_channels_available}, State};\n        [Channel | Rest] ->\n            {reply, {ok, Channel}, [Channel | Rest]}\n    end.\n\navailable_channels(State) ->\n    lists:subtract(all_channels(), State).\n\nall_channels() ->\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. % Example list of available channels\n```\n\n# Designing for scalability and fault tolerance\n\n\n\nOne important principle to keep in mind when designing for scalability is the idea of horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to a system to handle increased load, rather than relying on a single machine to handle all the traffic. In Erlang, this can be achieved by distributing processes across multiple nodes in a network.\n\nTo design for fault tolerance, it is important to understand the concept of supervision trees. Supervision trees provide a hierarchical structure for organizing processes, where supervisors monitor the behavior of worker processes and can restart them if they fail. This allows for the isolation of failures and the ability to recover from them quickly.\n\nLet's consider an example of designing for fault tolerance in a chat application. The application consists of multiple chat rooms, each managed by a separate process. If a chat room process crashes, it should be restarted automatically without affecting the other chat rooms.\n\n```erlang\n-module(chat_room).\n-behavior(supervisor).\n\n-export([start_link/0]).\n-export([create_room/1]).\n\nstart_link() ->\n    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).\n\ncreate_room(RoomId) ->\n    supervisor:start_child(?MODULE, [RoomId]).\n\ninit([]) ->\n    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, []}}.\n\n%% Callback functions for supervisor behavior\n\nchild_spec([RoomId]) ->\n    {chat_room_process, {chat_room_process, start_link, [RoomId]}, temporary, 5000, worker, [chat_room_process]}.\n\n%% Callback functions for worker behavior\n\nstart_link(RoomId) ->\n    spawn_link(fun() -> loop(RoomId) end).\n\nloop(RoomId) ->\n    receive\n        {join, User} ->\n            io:format(\&quot;User ~p joined room ~p~n\&quot;, [User, RoomId]),\n            loop(RoomId);\n        {leave, User} ->\n            io:format(\&quot;User ~p left room ~p~n\&quot;, [User, RoomId]),\n            loop(RoomId);\n        {message, User, Message} ->\n            io:format(\&quot;User ~p sent message ~p in room ~p~n\&quot;, [User, Message, RoomId]),\n            loop(RoomId)\n    end.\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a supervisor module called `chat_room` that manages multiple chat room processes. Each chat room process is responsible for handling join, leave, and message events in a specific chat room. If a chat room process crashes, the supervisor will automatically restart it.\n\n## Exercise\nConsider the example of the chat application. How would you modify the code to handle the case where a chat room process exceeds a certain threshold of errors and needs to be permanently terminated?\n\n### Solution\nYou can modify the supervisor's `init` function to specify a maximum restart intensity for the chat room processes. Once a chat room process exceeds the maximum restart intensity, it will be permanently terminated.\n\n```erlang\ninit([]) ->\n    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [{chat_room_process, {chat_room_process, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, worker, [chat_room_process]}]}}.\n```\n\nIn this example, we set the maximum restart intensity to 5, which means that a chat room process will be restarted at most 5 times within a 10-second period. If it exceeds this threshold, it will be permanently terminated.\n\n# The role of supervision trees in Erlang\n\n\n\nAt the core of a supervision tree are two types of processes: supervisors and workers. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the behavior of worker processes and taking appropriate actions in case of failures. Workers, on the other hand, are the actual processes that perform computations or handle specific tasks.\n\nSupervisors are organized in a tree-like structure, where each supervisor can have multiple child processes. This hierarchical arrangement allows for the isolation of failures and the ability to recover from them quickly. If a worker process crashes, its supervisor can restart it, ensuring that the system remains operational.\n\nLet's consider an example of a supervision tree in a web server application. The application consists of multiple worker processes, each responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. The supervisor for the web server is responsible for monitoring the behavior of these worker processes and restarting them if they fail.\n\n```erlang\n-module(web_server_supervisor).\n-behavior(supervisor).\n\n-export([start_link/0]).\n-export([init/1]).\n\nstart_link() ->\n    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).\n\ninit([]) ->\n    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [{web_server_worker, {web_server_worker, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, worker, [web_server_worker]}]}}.\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a supervisor module called `web_server_supervisor` that manages the web server worker processes. The supervisor's `init` function specifies the restart strategy (one_for_one), maximum restart intensity (5), and maximum restart time (10 seconds). It also defines the child specification for the worker processes.\n\n## Exercise\nConsider the example of the web server application. How would you modify the code to add a second level of supervisors that manage groups of worker processes?\n\n### Solution\nTo add a second level of supervisors, you can modify the supervisor's `init` function to include child specifications for the second level supervisors. Each second level supervisor can then have its own set of worker processes that it monitors.\n\n```erlang\ninit([]) ->\n    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [\n        {web_server_worker_supervisor_1, {web_server_worker_supervisor_1, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, supervisor, [web_server_worker_supervisor_1]},\n        {web_server_worker_supervisor_2, {web_server_worker_supervisor_2, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, supervisor, [web_server_worker_supervisor_2]}\n    ]}}.\n```\n\nIn this example, we add two second level supervisors (`web_server_worker_supervisor_1` and `web_server_worker_supervisor_2`) to the supervisor tree. Each second level supervisor can have its own set of worker processes that it monitors.\n\n# Maximizing performance through process management\n\n\n\nOne important aspect of process management is process creation and termination. Creating and terminating processes in Erlang is lightweight and efficient, but it's still important to minimize unnecessary process creation and termination to avoid unnecessary overhead.\n\nInstead of creating a new process for each individual task, it is often more efficient to use a pool of pre-created processes that can be reused for multiple tasks. This approach reduces the overhead of process creation and termination and improves overall system performance.\n\nLet's consider an example of a task scheduler in an Erlang application. Instead of creating a new process for each task, we can create a pool of worker processes that are responsible for executing tasks. When a new task arrives, it can be assigned to an available worker process from the pool.\n\n```erlang\n-module(task_scheduler).\n-export([start/0, schedule_task/1]).\n\nstart() ->\n    PoolSize = 10,\n    Pool = start_worker_processes(PoolSize),\n    loop(Pool).\n\nstart_worker_processes(N) ->\n    lists:map(fun(_) -> spawn_link(fun() -> worker() end) end, lists:seq(1, N)).\n\nloop(Pool) ->\n    receive\n        {task, Task} ->\n            {Worker, NewPool} = get_available_worker(Pool),\n            Worker ! {execute, Task},\n            loop(NewPool)\n    end.\n\nget_available_worker([{Worker, Status} | Rest]) ->\n    case Status of\n        busy ->\n            get_available_worker(Rest);\n        available ->\n            {Worker, [{Worker, busy} | Rest]}\n    end.\n\nworker() ->\n    receive\n        {execute, Task} ->\n            % Execute the task\n            execute_task(Task),\n            % Notify the scheduler that the worker is available\n            scheduler ! {worker_available, self()}\n    end,\n    worker().\n\nexecute_task(Task) ->\n    % Perform the task\n    ok.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `start` function initializes a pool of worker processes using the `start_worker_processes` function. The `loop` function receives tasks and assigns them to available worker processes from the pool.\n\n## Exercise\nConsider the task scheduler example. How would you modify the code to limit the number of tasks that can be queued at a time?\n\n### Solution\nTo limit the number of tasks that can be queued at a time, you can add a maximum queue size parameter to the `loop` function and check the queue size before accepting a new task. If the queue size exceeds the maximum, you can either reject the task or implement a queuing strategy such as dropping the oldest task in the queue.\n\n```erlang\nloop(MaxQueueSize, Queue, Pool) ->\n    receive\n        {task, Task} when length(Queue) < MaxQueueSize ->\n            {Worker, NewPool} = get_available_worker(Pool),\n            Worker ! {execute, Task},\n            loop(MaxQueueSize, [Task | Queue], NewPool)\n    end.\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the `loop` function, the maximum queue size is passed as a parameter, and the queue size is checked before accepting a new task. If the queue size exceeds the maximum, the task is not added to the queue.\n\n# Implementing message passing and concurrency in Erlang\n\n\n\nIn Erlang, processes communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. Message passing is asynchronous, meaning that a process can send a message and continue its execution without waiting for a response. This allows for concurrent execution and efficient use of system resources.\n\nTo send a message in Erlang, you use the `!` operator. For example, to send a message containing the atom `hello` to a process with the process identifier `Pid`, you would write `Pid ! hello`.\n\n```erlang\n-module(message_passing).\n-export([start/0]).\n\nstart() ->\n    Pid = spawn(fun() -> receiver() end),\n    Pid ! hello.\n\nreceiver() ->\n    receive\n        Message ->\n            io:format(\&quot;Received message: ~p~n\&quot;, [Message])\n    end.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `start` function spawns a new process that executes the `receiver` function. The `receiver` function waits for a message to be received and then prints the received message to the console.\n\n## Exercise\nModify the `message_passing` module to send multiple messages to the receiver process.\n\n### Solution\n```erlang\n-module(message_passing).\n-export([start/0]).\n\nstart() ->\n    Pid = spawn(fun() -> receiver() end),\n    Pid ! hello,\n    Pid ! world.\n\nreceiver() ->\n    receive\n        Message ->\n            io:format(\&quot;Received message: ~p~n\&quot;, [Message]),\n            receiver()\n    end.\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the `message_passing` module, two messages (`hello` and `world`) are sent to the receiver process. The receiver process will print each received message to the console and then wait for another message.\n\n# Utilizing OTP design patterns for performance optimization\n\n\n\nOne of the key design patterns in OTP is the use of supervisors and workers. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the behavior of worker processes and restarting them if they fail. This ensures that the application remains operational even in the presence of failures. By properly structuring your application into supervisors and workers, you can maximize performance and fault tolerance.\n\nAnother important OTP design pattern is the use of gen_servers. Gen_servers are generic servers that provide a standardized interface for handling requests and maintaining state. By using gen_servers, you can simplify the implementation of concurrent and distributed systems, and improve performance by reducing the overhead of managing state.\n\nIn addition to supervisors and gen_servers, OTP provides other design patterns and libraries that can be used to optimize performance. These include gen_fsm (finite state machines), gen_event (event handling), and gen_statem (state machines). By understanding and utilizing these design patterns, you can design and implement high-performance Erlang applications.\n\n```erlang\n-module(supervisor_example).\n-behaviour(supervisor).\n\n-export([start_link/0, init/1]).\n\nstart_link() ->\n    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).\n\ninit([]) ->\n    ChildSpecs = [\n        #{id => worker1, start => {worker, start_link, []}},\n        #{id => worker2, start => {worker, start_link, []}}\n    ],\n    {ok, { {one_for_one, 10, 10}, ChildSpecs}}.\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a supervisor module that starts two worker processes. If any of the worker processes fail, the supervisor will restart them. This ensures that the application remains operational even in the presence of failures.\n\n## Exercise\nModify the `supervisor_example` module to add a third worker process.\n\n### Solution\n```erlang\n-module(supervisor_example).\n-behaviour(supervisor).\n\n-export([start_link/0, init/1]).\n\nstart_link() ->\n    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).\n\ninit([]) ->\n    ChildSpecs = [\n        #{id => worker1, start => {worker, start_link, []}},\n        #{id => worker2, start => {worker, start_link, []}},\n        #{id => worker3, start => {worker, start_link, []}}\n    ],\n    {ok, { {one_for_one, 10, 10}, ChildSpecs}}.\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the `supervisor_example` module, a third worker process (`worker3`) is added to the supervisor. This allows for the supervision of three worker processes instead of two.\n\n# Tools and techniques for measuring and analyzing performance in Erlang\n\n\n\nOne of the key tools for measuring performance in Erlang is the `erlang:statistics` module. This module provides functions for collecting and retrieving various performance-related statistics, such as memory usage, process counts, and message queue lengths. By using these functions, you can gain insights into the performance characteristics of your application.\n\nAnother useful tool for measuring performance is the `fprof` module. This module provides a profiler that can be used to measure the execution time of Erlang functions. By profiling your code, you can identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.\n\nIn addition to these built-in tools, there are also third-party tools available for measuring and analyzing performance in Erlang. One such tool is `recon`, which provides a set of functions for monitoring and troubleshooting Erlang systems. `recon` includes features such as memory analysis, process inspection, and tracing.\n\n```erlang\n-module(performance_example).\n\n-export([fib/1]).\n\nfib(0) -> 0;\nfib(1) -> 1;\nfib(N) -> fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a simple Fibonacci function in Erlang. This function calculates the Nth Fibonacci number recursively. However, this implementation is not efficient and can be optimized.\n\n## Exercise\nUse the `fprof` module to profile the `fib/1` function and identify areas for optimization.\n\n### Solution\n```erlang\n1> c(performance_example).\n2> fprof:trace([call]).\n3> performance_example:fib(20).\n4> fprof:analyse().\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can profile the `fib/1` function and analyze its performance. The `fprof:trace([call])` function enables tracing of function calls, the `performance_example:fib(20)` function call executes the `fib/1` function, and the `fprof:analyse()` function provides a detailed analysis of the function's performance.\n\n# Best practices for maximizing Erlang performance\n\n\n\nOne important aspect to consider is the use of processes in Erlang. Processes are lightweight and can be created and terminated quickly. By using processes effectively, you can achieve high concurrency and parallelism, which can greatly improve performance.\n\nAnother best practice is to minimize the use of global variables and mutable state. Erlang is designed to be a functional programming language, and immutability is a key principle. By minimizing mutable state, you can avoid issues such as race conditions and improve the performance of your application.\n\nIn addition, it is important to optimize memory usage in Erlang. Erlang uses a garbage collector to manage memory, and inefficient memory usage can lead to performance bottlenecks. By minimizing memory allocations and reducing memory fragmentation, you can improve the overall performance of your application.\n\n```erlang\n-module(performance_example).\n\n-export([sum_list/1]).\n\nsum_list([]) -> 0;\nsum_list([H|T]) -> H + sum_list(T).\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a function `sum_list/1` that calculates the sum of a list of numbers. However, this implementation is not efficient and can be optimized.\n\n## Exercise\nOptimize the `sum_list/1` function to improve its performance.\n\n### Solution\n```erlang\n-module(performance_example).\n\n-export([sum_list/1]).\n\nsum_list(List) -> sum_list(List, 0).\n\nsum_list([], Acc) -> Acc;\nsum_list([H|T], Acc) -> sum_list(T, H + Acc).\n```\n\nIn this optimized version of the `sum_list/1` function, an accumulator (`Acc`) is used to keep track of the sum. This eliminates the need for recursive function calls and improves the performance of the function.\n\n# Case studies of successful Erlang implementations\n\n\n\nOne notable case study is the use of Erlang in the telecom industry. Erlang was originally developed by Ericsson for building telecom systems, and it has been widely adopted in this industry. Telecom systems require high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability, which are all strengths of Erlang. Companies such as Ericsson, WhatsApp, and T-Mobile have successfully used Erlang to build robust and reliable telecom systems.\n\nWhatsApp, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, is built on Erlang. Erlang's concurrency model and fault-tolerant design make it a perfect fit for handling the high volume of messages and ensuring reliable delivery. WhatsApp's use of Erlang has allowed it to scale to billions of users while maintaining a high level of performance and reliability.\n\nAnother case study is the use of Erlang in the financial industry. Erlang's ability to handle high concurrency and fault tolerance makes it well-suited for financial systems that require real-time processing and high availability. Companies such as Goldman Sachs and Klarna have successfully used Erlang to build high-performance trading systems and payment platforms.\n\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company, uses Erlang to power its payment platform. Erlang's ability to handle high concurrency and fault tolerance has allowed Klarna to process millions of transactions per day with low latency and high reliability. Erlang's scalability and performance have been key factors in Klarna's success.\n\n## Exercise\nResearch and find another case study of a successful Erlang implementation. Summarize the case study and explain how Erlang was used to achieve high performance.\n\n### Solution\nOne example of a successful Erlang implementation is the use of Erlang in the gaming industry. Game developers such as CCP Games, the creators of the popular game EVE Online, have used Erlang to build highly scalable and fault-tolerant game servers. Erlang's lightweight processes and message passing model make it well-suited for handling the high concurrency and real-time communication required in online multiplayer games. By using Erlang, CCP Games has been able to create a highly immersive and seamless gaming experience for millions of players around the world.\n\n# Future developments and advancements in Erlang\n\n\n\nOne area of future development in Erlang is the improvement of its runtime system. The Erlang runtime system, known as the BEAM, is responsible for executing Erlang code and managing processes. Efforts are being made to optimize the BEAM to improve performance and reduce memory usage. This will allow Erlang to handle even larger workloads and scale more effectively.\n\nOne specific improvement being worked on is the implementation of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in the BEAM. JIT compilation can dynamically optimize code at runtime, resulting in faster execution and reduced memory usage. This will further enhance Erlang's performance and make it even more efficient.\n\nAnother area of future development is the expansion of Erlang's ecosystem. Erlang has a strong community of developers and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Efforts are being made to further expand this ecosystem by developing new libraries and tools that make it easier to build and deploy Erlang applications. This will make Erlang even more accessible and attractive to developers.\n\nOne example of a new tool being developed is Lasp, a distributed programming model for Erlang. Lasp provides a high-level abstraction for building distributed applications, making it easier to write scalable and fault-tolerant systems. Lasp is being actively developed and has the potential to greatly simplify the development of distributed Erlang applications.\n\nIn addition to these technical advancements, there is also ongoing research and development in the field of programming languages and distributed systems that can benefit Erlang. New techniques and concepts are being explored that can further enhance Erlang's capabilities and make it even more powerful and versatile.\n\nOne area of research is the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in Erlang. By combining Erlang's concurrency model with machine learning algorithms, it is possible to build intelligent and adaptive systems that can automatically optimize performance and make real-time decisions. This has the potential to revolutionize how Erlang applications are built and operated.\n\n## Exercise\nResearch and find another future development or advancement in Erlang. Summarize the development or advancement and explain how it can benefit Erlang.\n\n### Solution\nOne future development in Erlang is the integration of WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for the web that allows code to run in a web browser at near-native speed. By integrating WebAssembly into Erlang, it will be possible to run Erlang code directly in the browser, opening up new possibilities for web applications and enabling the use of Erlang's concurrency model and fault-tolerance in web development. This integration will make it easier to build highly scalable and reliable web applications using Erlang.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vikp/textbook_quality_programming&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:1,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Lesson: Understanding Gambling Advertising Regulations\n\nIntroduction:\nGambling is a popular pastime in many countries, including Italy. However, like many other forms of entertainment, it can be addictive if not managed properly. This is why governments have put in place rules and regulations to control the industry and protect consumers from its negative effects. One such regulation is the restriction of gambling advertising, which is aimed at preventing excessive exposure to gambling and minimizing its appeal to minors.\n\nCore Value:\nThe core value of this lesson is to understand the importance of gambling advertising regulations and how they are implemented to protect consumers.\n\nSection 1: Theoretical Concepts\nTopic 1: What are gambling advertising regulations?\nGambling advertising regulations are rules and guidelines set by governments to control the promotion of gambling products and services. They are designed to prevent excessive exposure to gambling and minimize its appeal to minors.\n\nTopic 2: Why are gambling advertising regulations important?\nGambling advertising regulations are important because they help to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, such as addiction and financial harm. They also help to ensure that gambling remains a form of entertainment rather than a necessity.\n\nSection 2: Practical Examples\nTopic 1: How are gambling advertising regulations implemented in Italy?\nIn Italy, gambling advertising regulations are implemented through a set of rules that govern the content and timing of gambling ads. For example, gambling ads are not allowed during programs that are likely to be watched by minors. Additionally, ads must clearly specify the percentage of the payout from the gambling in question.\n\nTopic 2: What are some examples of gambling advertising regulations in Italy?\nSome examples of gambling advertising regulations in Italy include:\n- Prohibition of gambling ads during programs that are likely to be watched by minors\n- Requirement to clearly specify the percentage of the payout from the gambling in question\n- Prohibition of ads that create an incentive to gamble or exalt the game\n\nSection 3: Self-Debating Discussions\nTopic 1: Are gambling advertising regulations effective?\nGambling advertising regulations can be effective in reducing the appeal of gambling to minors and preventing excessive exposure to gambling. However, they may not be effective in preventing problem gambling among adults who are already addicted to gambling.\n\nTopic 2: Should gambling advertising regulations be stricter?\nThere are arguments for and against stricter gambling advertising regulations. Some people believe that stricter regulations would reduce the appeal of gambling and prevent more people from becoming addicted. Others argue that stricter regulations would infringe on personal freedoms and could lead to a black market for gambling products and services.\n\nGlossary:\n- Gambling: The act of playing games of chance for money or other stakes.\n- Regulation: A rule or set of rules that governs behavior or activity.\n- Advertising: The promotion of goods or services through various media channels.\n\nConclusion:\nGambling advertising regulations are an important tool for protecting consumers from the negative effects of gambling. By understanding the principles behind these regulations and how they are implemented, we can make informed decisions about our own gambling habits and help others do the same.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:2,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Design of flip-OFDM system for optical wireless communication\n\nOptical wireless communication (OWC) has captivated an increasing interest in academia and industry recently with the widespread deployment of light emitting diodes (LEDs). OWC has been expected to be an appealing alternative to radio frequency (RF) systems due to its distinct advantages that include rich spectrum resources and high communication security. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is employed in OWC to achieve high data rates and bearable inter-symbol interference (ISI). This paper focuses on designing a Flip-OFDM system for OWC. The performance of the Flip-OFDM OWC system is compared with the conventional OWC system employing QAM. From the simulation result, it is clear that the proposed system can provide a tremendous improvement in BER performance and high data rate can also be achieved and is well suited for future 5G applications.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:3,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Successful Quality Efforts in Higher Education: It Can Be Done Within Continuing Education Departments\n\nH igher education institutions are being challenged to be more responsive, effective, and efficient in the same way American businesses have been challenged over the past two decades (Alexander, 2000; Cullen, Joyce, Hassall, &amp; Broadbent, 2003). As a result, these institutions are attempting to implement many of the same operational and quality improvement methods that have worked successfully in business and industry (Birn­ baum, 1999; Carey, 1998; Fritz, 1993; Xue, 1998). Such organizational improvement efforts are often referred to as Total Quality Management (TQM) practices and include approaches such as benchmarking, Six Sigma programs, and the Baldrige National Quality award criteria. While there have been some successful TQM efforts within higher education, there are also reports that schools have reduced in scope or totally dropped such quality improvement programs. For example, Birnbaum 0999) determined 41% of higher education institutions that had adopted formal quality efforts later discontinued those programs. Klocinski (1999) reports that, of 46 higher education institutions implementing such efforts in 1991, only 17 still had those processes underway in 1996. These results were counter-balanced, however, by an increased number of institutions implementing TQM, from 46 to 155 over the same time period (Klosinski, 1999). Birnbaum (1999) notes that, overall, it is difficult to sift through the various studies to find an accurate answer, but he concludes TQM has not been maintained as an active process in higher education. Researchers have identified many factors that nega­ tively impact the implementation of formal quality efforts in higher education. These include faculty resistance (Albert &amp; Pet-Armacost, 2002; Nixon, Helms, &amp; Williams, 2001), lack of team-based reward systems (Albert &amp; Pet-Armacost, 2002; Fritz, 1993), the difficulty in defining customer and quality, particularly within the academic areas of a university (Lawrence &amp; Sharma, 2002; Nixon et a!, 2001), lack of leadership support (Benson, 2000; Xue, 1998), limited collection of appropriate data (Fritz, 1993), lack of teamwork (Dailey &amp; Bishop, 2003), and overall cultural differences between higher education and business (Albert &amp; Pet-Carmacost, 2002; Birnbaum, 2000; Roopchand, 1997). These negative findings are tempered, however, by researchers' concern that many previous studies have primarily focused on the use of TQM as an institution-wide initiative. The limited successes may not be surprising given that higher education institutions tend to be loosely coupled organizations that have difficulties implementing system-wide improvement processes (Bush, 1995). Loosely coupled organizations are made up of sub-units (e.g., departments) with few commonalities among them; there­ fore, pressures upon one department may not affect the entire organization (Weick, 1979). Within such a loosely coupled, open system, inputs from the external environment&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:4,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Cell-specific production and antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones in roots of lithospermum erythrorhizon\n\nPigmented naphthoquinone derivatives of shikonin are produced at specific times and in specific cells of Lithospermum erythrorhizon roots. Normal pigment development is limited to root hairs and root border cells in hairy roots grown on \&quot;noninducing\&quot; medium, whereas induction of additional pigment production by abiotic (CuSO4) or biotic (fungal elicitor) factors increases the amount of total pigment, changes the ratios of derivatives produced, and initiates production of pigment de novo in epidermal cells. When the biological activity of these compounds was tested against soil-borne bacteria and fungi, a wide range of sensitivity was recorded. Acetyl-shikonin and beta-hydroxyisovaleryl-shikonin, the two most abundant derivatives in both Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed \&quot;hairy-root\&quot; cultures and greenhouse-grown plant roots, were the most biologically active of the seven compounds tested. Hyphae of the pathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, and Nectria hematococca induced localized pigment production upon contact with the roots. Challenge by R. solani crude elicitor increased shikonin derivative production 30-fold.

By applying critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills, we can adapt these plans to new problems and challenges. Through our study of regeneration masterplans, we can become better equipped to address the needs of our communities and improve the quality of life for all residents.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:6,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Prototype of a rectal wall ultrasound image analysis system\n\nThis paper presents a software system prototype for rectal wall ultrasound image processing, image display and 3D reconstruction and visualization of the rectal wall structure, which is aimed to help surgeons cope with large quantities of rectal wall ultrasound images.

Biopolis, however, is itself the result of a long-term effort to build up capacities for biotechnological research. The present article analyzes the early (pre-Biopolis) biotechnology discourse in Singapore, with special emphasis on its representations in the official media and on its strategic uses by the various stakeholders involved. Against the backdrop of the global emergence of biotechnology from the late 1970s onward, the article traces the motivations for Singapore's formulation of its own biotechnology policy, paying attention throughout to the dynamic between scientists and policy makers. It is this relationship, along with the ambiguities that characterize it, that is responsible for the sustained establishment of biotechnology in Singapore. At an interpretative level, an attempt is made to compare the case of Singapore's biotechnology policy with competing discourses of technology and modernity. The discourse on biotechnology can thus be recognized as a means of mobilizing its intended audience for the various stages in the country's path toward (real or perceived) modernization.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:8,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Lesson: Introduction to Business Ownership\n\n**Section 1: Understanding Business Ownership**\n\nTopic: What is business ownership?\n\nBusiness ownership refers to the act of owning and operating a business.

The treatments were as follows: (T1) a cover layer with 50 cm of partially weathered spoil (B1) with lime added over a compacted sealing layer with 30 cm of B1; (T2) a cover layer with 25 cm of limed native soil over 25 cm of limed B1 over a compacted sealing layer of 30 cm of B1; (T3) a cover layer with 50 cm of limed B1 over a compacted sealing layer of 20 cm of limed soil over 20 cm of unlimed B1; and (T4) a cover layer with 25 cm of limed soil over 25 cm of limed B1 over 20 cm of compacted limed soil over 20 cm of unlimed B1. The plant species used were Acacia farnesiana, A. holosericea, A. polyphylla, Albizia lebbeck, Clitoria fairchildiana, Flemingia sp., Mimosa artemisiana, M. bimucronata, and Enterolobium timbauva. Experimental data included diameter of the stem collar (DC), plant height, and survival counts. The greatest survival rate was observed with T4, at 80%. In general, M. bimucronata and A. farnesiana species showed the highest survival rate. The Scott-Knott test a p < 5% indicated that A. holosericea had the greatest growth-response, while A. polyphylla, Flemingia sp., and E. timbauva exhibited lower growth rates. The bioavailable soil As content from (T1), (T2), (T3), and (T4) was 14.69, 0.00, 10.41, and 0.00 mg dm -3 , respectively. These experimental results support the conclusion that presence of native soil is essential for establishment of plants and minimization of plant toxins like As in mine reclamation efforts, and that appropriate implementation of layer combinations such as studied here allows greater survival rates and biomass gains.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:12,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Local involvement of the bladder or rectumB.

Certain cervical cancers that are confined to the cervix may be treated surgically. Very small lesions (less than 7 mm wide, less than 3 mm deep) with no LVSI may be treated with simple hysterectomy. In a woman who desires future fertility, a cone biopsy with negative surgical margins may be an acceptable alternative. Any tumor larger than this (larger than stage IA1) should be treated with radical hysterectomy or in special cases radical trachelectomy for fertility preservation.

Pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a man named Anthony who wanted to help people start their own businesses. He wrote a book called Nolo's Quick LLC to teach them how to form a special type of business called an LLC.\n\nAn LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is like a superhero suit for your business. It helps protect you from bad guys like lawsuits and taxes. But, just like a superhero, you have to follow certain rules to wear the suit properly.\n\nIn his book, Anthony tells the story of a brave entrepreneur named Jane who wants to start her own business. She decides to form an LLC to protect herself and her business. First, she has to choose the right type of superhero suit for her business. There are many types of suits, but Jane decides that an LLC is the best one for her.\n\nNext, Jane has to create a special document called articles of organization. This document is like a blueprint for her superhero suit. She has to fill it out with information about her business, like its name and address. Then, she has to send it to a special group of people called the secretary of state.\n\nAfter that, Jane has to get a special number called an EIN. This number is like a secret code that allows her business to talk to the government. She has to apply for this number online or by mail.\n\nNext, Jane needs to create a written agreement called an operating agreement. This agreement is like a set of rules for her superhero suit. It tells everyone who is part of her business what their jobs are and how they should work together.\n\nFinally, Jane has to follow some rules to keep her superhero suit in good shape. She has to tell the government how much money her business made each year, and she has to pay taxes on that money. She also has to keep her business information up-to-date, so that people can find her if they need to.\n\nWith the help of Anthony's book, Jane is able to start her own business and protect herself from the bad guys. And she lives happily ever after, knowing that her business is safe and secure.\n\nAnd that's the end of the story. But remember, kids, if you want to start your own business, you can use Anthony's book to help you too. Just follow the steps he outlines, and you'll be on your way to becoming a successful entrepreneur!&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:14,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;[Diagnosis of rejection in a transplanted liver].\n\nDespite advances in immunosupressive therapy rejection remains the most common complication of liver transplantation in both the early and the late post-transplant period. Unlike other solid organs, liver graft rejection has some specific characteristics likely attributable to the unique immunobiologic properties and the remarkable regenerative capabilities of liver parenchyma. Acute cellular rejection is the most frequent type of the rejection episode in the liver allograft, whereas chronic (ductopenic) rejection and humoral rejection are uncommon. Since the clinical findings are not entirely characteristic, histopathological evaluation of liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of rejection.

Second, this paper constructs a road network model on the basis of complex network and link resistance model to connect different traffic sub-zones. In addition, on the assumption that reasonable people usually choose the shortest path with minimum link resistance as their travel path, a mapping algorithm from travel demand to volume of traffic flow is introduced in our model. On the basis of the discrete-event simulation method, a simulation prototype system on PC is implemented. Experimental results show that this simulation system can simulate the dynamic evolution of travel demand and traffic flow in real time way and the model is effective.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:17,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;# Step 2A: Feature Engineering\n\nThis notebook executes the second step of a data science process, manipulate and transform the raw data sets into an analysis data set for constructing a machine learning model, or for the machine learning model to consume. You must run the `1_data_ingestion` notebook before running this notebook.\n\nThe scenario is constructed as a pipeline flow, where each notebook is optimized to perform in a batch setting for each of the ingest, feature engineering, model building, model scoring operations. To accomplish this, this `2a_feature_engineering` notebook is designed to be used to generate a general data set for any of the training, calibrate, test or scoring operations. In this scenario, we use a temporal split strategy for these operations, so the notebook parameters are used to set date range filtering. The notebook creates a labeled data set using the parameters start_date and to_date to select the time period for training. This data set is stored in the features_table specified. After this cell completes, you should see the dataset under the Databricks Data icon.\n\nYou can `Run All` cells, or use the Databricks CLI to create a Databricks Job to do the same process automatically.\n\nTo examine the SPARK analysis data sets constructed in this notebook, the optional `2a_feature_exploration` notebook has been included in the repostiory and copied to your Azure Databricks Workspace. You must run this `engineering` notebook before running the `exploration` notebook, which details the feature dataset created here for use in this predictive maintenance solution example.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia, Feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. \n\nThis Feature engineering notebook will load the data sets created in the **Data Ingestion** notebook (`1_data_ingestion`) from an Azure storage container and combine them to create a single data set of features (variables) that can be used to infer a machines's health condition over time. The notebook steps through several feature engineering and labeling methods to create this data set for use in our predictive maintenance machine learning solution.\n\n**Note:** This notebook will take  less than a minute to execute all cells, depending on the compute configuration you have setup.\n\n```\n## Setup our environment by importing required libraries\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\nimport pyspark\n\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import OneHotEncoder\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, unix_timestamp, round\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import datediff\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType\nfrom pyspark.sql.window import Window\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n# These file names detail which blob each files is stored under. \nMACH_DATA = 'machines_data'\nMAINT_DATA = 'maint_data'\nERROR_DATA = 'errors_data'\nTELEMETRY_DATA = 'telemetry_data'\nFAILURE_DATA = 'failure_data'\ndbutils.widgets.removeAll()\ndbutils.widgets.text(\&quot;features_table\&quot;,\&quot;training_data\&quot;)\n\ndbutils.widgets.text(\&quot;start_date\&quot;, '2000-01-01')\n\ndbutils.widgets.text(\&quot;to_date\&quot;, '2015-10-30')\n```\n\n## Feature engineering \n\nOur feature engineering will combine the different data sources together to create a single data set of features (variables) that can be used to infer a machines's health condition over time. The ultimate goal is to generate a single record for each time unit within each asset. The record combines features and labels to be fed into the machine learning algorithm.\n\nPredictive maintenance take historical data, marked with a timestamp, to predict current health of a component and the probability of failure within some future window of time. These problems can be characterised as a _classification method_ involving _time series_ data. Time series, since we want to use historical observations to predict what will happen in the future. Classification, because we classify the future as having a probability of failure.\n\n### Lag features\n\nThere are many ways of creating features from the time series data. We start by dividing the duration of data collection into time units where each record belongs to a single point in time for each asset. The measurement unit for is in fact arbitrary. Time can be in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or months, or it can be measured in cycles, miles or transactions. The measurement choice is typically specific to the use case domain.\n\nAdditionally, the time unit does not have to be the same as the frequency of data collection. For example, if temperature values were being collected every 10 seconds, picking a time unit of 10 seconds for analysis may inflate the number of examples without providing any additional information if the temperature changes slowly. A better strategy may be to average the temperature over a longer time horizon which might better capture variations that contribute to the target outcome.\n\nOnce we set the frequency of observations, we want to look for trends within measures, over time, in order to predict performance degradation, which we would like to connect to how likely a component will fail. We create features for these trends within each record using time lags over previous observations to check for these performance changes. The lag window size $W$ is a hyper parameter that we can optimize. The following figures indicate a _rolling aggregate window_ strategy for averaging a measure $t_i$ over a window $W = 3$ previous observations. We are not constrained to averages, we can roll aggregates over counts, average, the standard deviation, outliers based on standard deviations, CUSUM measures, minimum and maximum values for the window. \n\n![Rolling Aggregates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance/master/images/rolling-aggregate-features.png)\n\nWe could also use a tumbling window approach, if we were interested in a different time window measure than the frequncy of the observations. For example, we might have obersvations evert 6 or 12 hours, but want to create features aligned on a day or week basis.  \n\n\n![Tumbling Aggregates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance/master/images/tumbling-aggregate-features.png)\n\nIn the following sections, we will build our features using only a rolling strategy to demonstrate the process. We align our data, and then build features along those normalized observations times. We start with the telemetry data.\n\n## Telemetry features\n\nBecause the telemetry data set is the largest time series data we have, we start feature engineering here. The telemetry data has 8761000 hourly observations for out 1000 machines. We can improve the model performance by aligning our data by aggregating average sensor measures on a tumbling 12 hour window. In this case we replace the raw data with the tumbling window data, reducing the sensor data to 731000 observations. This will directly reduce the computaton time required to do the feature engineering, labeling and modeling required for our solution.    \n\nOnce we have the reduced data, we set up our lag features by compute rolling aggregate measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc. to represent the short term history of the telemetry over time. \n\nThe following code blocks alignes the data on 12 hour observations and calculates a rolling mean and standard deviation of the telemetry data over the last 12, 24 and 36 hour lags.\n\n```\nTO_DATE = dbutils.widgets.get(\&quot;to_date\&quot;)\nSTART_DATE = dbutils.widgets.get(\&quot;start_date\&quot;)\ntelemetry = spark.table(TELEMETRY_DATA).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) <= TO_DATE).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) > START_DATE).cache()\n\n# rolling mean and standard deviation\n# Temporary storage for rolling means\ntel_mean = telemetry\n\n# Which features are we interested in telemetry data set\nrolling_features = ['volt','rotate', 'pressure', 'vibration']\n      \n# n hours = n * 3600 seconds  \ntime_val = 12 * 3600\n\n# Choose the time_val hour timestamps to align the data\n# dt_truncated looks at the column named \&quot;datetime\&quot; in the current data set.\n# remember that Spark is lazy... this doesn't execute until it is in a withColumn statement.\ndt_truncated = ((round(unix_timestamp(col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;)) / time_val) * time_val).cast(\&quot;timestamp\&quot;))\n# We choose windows for our rolling windows 12hrs, 24 hrs and 36 hrs\nlags = [12, 24, 36]\n\n# align the data\nfor lag_n in lags:\n    wSpec = Window.partitionBy('machineID').orderBy('datetime').rowsBetween(1-lag_n, 0)\n    for col_name in rolling_features:\n        tel_mean = tel_mean.withColumn(col_name+'_rollingmean_'+str(lag_n), \n                                       F.avg(col(col_name)).over(wSpec))\n        tel_mean = tel_mean.withColumn(col_name+'_rollingstd_'+str(lag_n), \n                                       F.stddev(col(col_name)).over(wSpec))\n\n# Calculate lag values...\ntelemetry_feat = (tel_mean.withColumn(\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;, dt_truncated)\n                  .drop('volt', 'rotate', 'pressure', 'vibration')\n                  .fillna(0)\n                  .groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;)\n                  .agg(F.mean('volt_rollingmean_12').alias('volt_rollingmean_12'),\n                       F.mean('rotate_rollingmean_12').alias('rotate_rollingmean_12'), \n                       F.mean('pressure_rollingmean_12').alias('pressure_rollingmean_12'), \n                       F.mean('vibration_rollingmean_12').alias('vibration_rollingmean_12'), \n                       F.mean('volt_rollingmean_24').alias('volt_rollingmean_24'),\n                       F.mean('rotate_rollingmean_24').alias('rotate_rollingmean_24'), \n                       F.mean('pressure_rollingmean_24').alias('pressure_rollingmean_24'), \n                       F.mean('vibration_rollingmean_24').alias('vibration_rollingmean_24'),\n                       F.mean('volt_rollingmean_36').alias('volt_rollingmean_36'),\n                       F.mean('vibration_rollingmean_36').alias('vibration_rollingmean_36'),\n                       F.mean('rotate_rollingmean_36').alias('rotate_rollingmean_36'), \n                       F.mean('pressure_rollingmean_36').alias('pressure_rollingmean_36'), \n                       F.stddev('volt_rollingstd_12').alias('volt_rollingstd_12'),\n                       F.stddev('rotate_rollingstd_12').alias('rotate_rollingstd_12'), \n                       F.stddev('pressure_rollingstd_12').alias('pressure_rollingstd_12'), \n                       F.stddev('vibration_rollingstd_12').alias('vibration_rollingstd_12'), \n                       F.stddev('volt_rollingstd_24').alias('volt_rollingstd_24'),\n                       F.stddev('rotate_rollingstd_24').alias('rotate_rollingstd_24'), \n                       F.stddev('pressure_rollingstd_24').alias('pressure_rollingstd_24'), \n                       F.stddev('vibration_rollingstd_24').alias('vibration_rollingstd_24'),\n                       F.stddev('volt_rollingstd_36').alias('volt_rollingstd_36'),\n                       F.stddev('rotate_rollingstd_36').alias('rotate_rollingstd_36'), \n                       F.stddev('pressure_rollingstd_36').alias('pressure_rollingstd_36'), \n                       F.stddev('vibration_rollingstd_36').alias('vibration_rollingstd_36'), )).cache()\n```\n\n## Errors features\n\nLike telemetry data, errors come with timestamps. An important difference is that the error IDs are categorical values and should not be averaged over time intervals like the telemetry measurements. Instead, we count the number of errors of each type within a lag window. \n\nAgain, we align the error counts data by tumbling over the 12 hour window using a join with telemetry data.\n\n```\nerrors = spark.table(ERROR_DATA).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) <= TO_DATE).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) > START_DATE).cache()\n\n# create a column for each errorID \nerror_ind = (errors.groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;datetime\&quot;,\&quot;errorID\&quot;).pivot('errorID')\n             .agg(F.count('machineID').alias('dummy')).drop('errorID').fillna(0)\n             .groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;datetime\&quot;)\n             .agg(F.sum('error1').alias('error1sum'), \n                  F.sum('error2').alias('error2sum'), \n                  F.sum('error3').alias('error3sum'), \n                  F.sum('error4').alias('error4sum'), \n                  F.sum('error5').alias('error5sum')))\n\n# join the telemetry data with errors\nerror_count = (telemetry.join(error_ind, \n                              ((telemetry['machineID'] == error_ind['machineID']) \n                               &amp; (telemetry['datetime'] == error_ind['datetime'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n               .drop('volt', 'rotate', 'pressure', 'vibration')\n               .drop(error_ind.machineID).drop(error_ind.datetime)\n               .fillna(0))\n\nerror_features = ['error1sum','error2sum', 'error3sum', 'error4sum', 'error5sum']\n\nwSpec = Window.partitionBy('machineID').orderBy('datetime').rowsBetween(1-24, 0)\nfor col_name in error_features:\n    # We're only interested in the erros in the previous 24 hours.\n    error_count = error_count.withColumn(col_name+'_rollingmean_24', \n                                         F.avg(col(col_name)).over(wSpec))\n\nerror_feat = (error_count.withColumn(\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;, dt_truncated)\n              .drop('error1sum', 'error2sum', 'error3sum', 'error4sum', 'error5sum').fillna(0)\n              .groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;)\n              .agg(F.mean('error1sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error1sum_rollingmean_24'), \n                   F.mean('error2sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error2sum_rollingmean_24'), \n                   F.mean('error3sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error3sum_rollingmean_24'), \n                   F.mean('error4sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error4sum_rollingmean_24'), \n                   F.mean('error5sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error5sum_rollingmean_24')))\n```\n\n## Days since last replacement from maintenance \n\nA crucial data set in this example is the use of maintenance records, which contain the information regarding component replacement. Possible features from this data set can be the number of replacements of each component over time or to calculate how long it has been since a component has been replaced. Replacement time is expected to correlate better with component failures since the longer a component is used, the more degradation would be expected.\n\nAs a side note, creating lagging features from maintenance data is not straight forward. This type of ad-hoc feature engineering is very common in predictive maintenance as domain knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the predictors of a failure problem. In the following code blocks, the days since last component replacement are calculated for each component from the maintenance data. We start by counting the component replacements for the set of machines.\n\n```\nmaint = spark.table(MAINT_DATA).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) <= TO_DATE).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) > START_DATE).cache()\n\n# create a column for each component replacement\nmaint_replace = (maint.groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;datetime\&quot;,\&quot;comp\&quot;).pivot('comp')\n                 .agg(F.count('machineID').alias('dummy')).fillna(0)\n                 .groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;datetime\&quot;)\n                 .agg(F.sum('comp1').alias('comp1sum'), \n                      F.sum('comp2').alias('comp2sum'), \n                      F.sum('comp3').alias('comp3sum'),\n                      F.sum('comp4').alias('comp4sum'))\n                 .withColumnRenamed('datetime','datetime_maint')).cache()\n```\n\nReplacement features are then created by tracking the number of days between each component replacement. We'll repeat these calculations for each of the four components and join them together into a maintenance feature table.\n\nFirst component number 1 (`comp1`):\n\n```\n# We want to align the component information on telemetry features timestamps.\ntelemetry_times = (telemetry_feat.select(telemetry_feat.machineID, telemetry_feat.dt_truncated)\n                   .withColumnRenamed('dt_truncated','datetime_tel')).cache()\ndef grab_component_records(self, telemetry_times, comp_sum=\&quot;comp1sum\&quot;, sincelastcomp_=\&quot;sincelastcomp1\&quot;,\n                          comp_a='comp2sum', comp_b='comp3sum', comp_c='comp4sum'):\n    maint_comp = (self.where(col(comp_sum) == '1').withColumnRenamed('datetime', 'datetime_maint')\n                  .drop(comp_a, comp_b, comp_c)).cache()\n    # Within each machine, get the last replacement date for each timepoint\n    maint_tel_comp = (telemetry_times.join(maint_comp,\n                                           ((telemetry_times['machineID'] == maint_comp['machineID'])\n                                            &amp; (telemetry_times['datetime_tel'] > maint_comp['datetime_maint'])\n                                            &amp; (maint_comp[(comp_sum)] == '1')))\n                      .drop(maint_comp.machineID)).cache()\n    # Calculate the number of days between replacements\n    return (maint_tel_comp.withColumn(sincelastcomp_,\n                                      datediff(maint_tel_comp.datetime_tel, maint_tel_comp.datetime_maint))\n            .drop(maint_tel_comp.datetime_maint).drop(maint_tel_comp[comp_sum])).cache()\n\npyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.grab_component_records = grab_component_records\n\n# Grab component 1 records\ncomp1 = maint_replace.grab_component_records(telemetry_times, comp_sum=\&quot;comp1sum\&quot;, sincelastcomp_=\&quot;sincelastcomp1\&quot;,\n                                            comp_a='comp2sum', comp_b='comp3sum', comp_c='comp4sum').cache()\ncomp2 = maint_replace.grab_component_records(telemetry_times, comp_sum=\&quot;comp2sum\&quot;, sincelastcomp_=\&quot;sincelastcomp2\&quot;,\n                                            comp_a='comp1sum', comp_b='comp3sum', comp_c='comp4sum').cache()\ncomp3 = maint_replace.grab_component_records(telemetry_times, comp_sum=\&quot;comp3sum\&quot;, sincelastcomp_=\&quot;sincelastcomp3\&quot;,\n                                            comp_a='comp1sum', comp_b='comp2sum', comp_c='comp4sum').cache()\ncomp4 = maint_replace.grab_component_records(telemetry_times, comp_sum=\&quot;comp4sum\&quot;, sincelastcomp_=\&quot;sincelastcomp4\&quot;,\n                                            comp_a='comp1sum', comp_b='comp2sum', comp_c='comp3sum').cache()\n# Join component 3 and 4\ncomp3_4 = (comp3.join(comp4, ((comp3['machineID'] == comp4['machineID']) \n                              &amp; (comp3['datetime_tel'] == comp4['datetime_tel'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n           .drop(comp4.machineID).drop(comp4.datetime_tel)).cache()\n\n# Join component 2 to 3 and 4\ncomp2_3_4 = (comp2.join(comp3_4, ((comp2['machineID'] == comp3_4['machineID']) \n                                  &amp; (comp2['datetime_tel'] == comp3_4['datetime_tel'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n             .drop(comp3_4.machineID).drop(comp3_4.datetime_tel)).cache()\n\n# Join component 1 to 2, 3 and 4\ncomps_feat = (comp1.join(comp2_3_4, ((comp1['machineID'] == comp2_3_4['machineID']) \n                                      &amp; (comp1['datetime_tel'] == comp2_3_4['datetime_tel'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n               .drop(comp2_3_4.machineID).drop(comp2_3_4.datetime_tel)\n               .groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;, \&quot;datetime_tel\&quot;)\n               .agg(F.max('sincelastcomp1').alias('sincelastcomp1'), \n                    F.max('sincelastcomp2').alias('sincelastcomp2'), \n                    F.max('sincelastcomp3').alias('sincelastcomp3'), \n                    F.max('sincelastcomp4').alias('sincelastcomp4'))\n               .fillna(0)).cache()\n\n# Choose the time_val hour timestamps to align the data\ndt_truncated = ((round(unix_timestamp(col(\&quot;datetime_tel\&quot;)) / time_val) * time_val).cast(\&quot;timestamp\&quot;))\n\n# Collect data\nmaint_feat = (comps_feat.withColumn(\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;, dt_truncated)\n              .groupBy(\&quot;machineID\&quot;,\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;)\n              .agg(F.mean('sincelastcomp1').alias('comp1sum'), \n                   F.mean('sincelastcomp2').alias('comp2sum'), \n                   F.mean('sincelastcomp3').alias('comp3sum'), \n                   F.mean('sincelastcomp4').alias('comp4sum'))).cache()\n```\n\n## Machine features\n\nThe machine features capture specifics of the individuals. These can be used without further modification since it include descriptive information about the type of each machine and its age (number of years in service). If the age information had been recorded as a \&quot;first use date\&quot; for each machine, a transformation would have been necessary to turn those into a numeric values indicating the years in service.\n\nWe do need to create a set of dummy features, a set of boolean variables, to indicate the model of the machine. This can either be done manually, or using a _one-hot encoding_ step. We use the one-hot encoding for demonstration purposes.\n\n```\nmachines = spark.table(MACH_DATA).cache()\n\n# one hot encoding of the variable model, basically creates a set of dummy boolean variables\ncatVarNames = ['model']  \nsIndexers = [StringIndexer(inputCol=x, outputCol=x + '_indexed') for x in catVarNames]\nmachines_cat = Pipeline(stages=sIndexers).fit(machines).transform(machines)\n\n# one-hot encode\nohEncoders = [OneHotEncoder(inputCol=x + '_indexed', outputCol=x + '_encoded')\n              for x in catVarNames]\n\nohPipelineModel = Pipeline(stages=ohEncoders).fit(machines_cat)\nmachines_cat = ohPipelineModel.transform(machines_cat)\n\ndrop_list = [col_n for col_n in machines_cat.columns if 'indexed' in col_n]\n\nmachines_feat = machines_cat.select([column for column in machines_cat.columns if column not in drop_list]).cache()\n```\n\n## Merging feature data\n\nNext, we merge the telemetry, maintenance, machine and error feature data sets into a large feature data set. Since most of the data has already been aligned on the 12 hour observation period, we can merge with a simple join strategy.\n\n```\n# join error features with component maintenance features\nerror_maint = (error_feat.join(maint_feat, \n                               ((error_feat['machineID'] == maint_feat['machineID']) \n                                &amp; (error_feat['dt_truncated'] == maint_feat['dt_truncated'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n               .drop(maint_feat.machineID).drop(maint_feat.dt_truncated))\n\n# now join that with machines features\nerror_maint_feat = (error_maint.join(machines_feat, \n                                     ((error_maint['machineID'] == machines_feat['machineID'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n                    .drop(machines_feat.machineID))\n\n# Clean up some unecessary columns\nerror_maint_feat = error_maint_feat.select([c for c in error_maint_feat.columns if c not in \n                                            {'error1sum', 'error2sum', 'error3sum', 'error4sum', 'error5sum'}])\n\n# join telemetry with error/maint/machine features to create final feature matrix\nfinal_feat = (telemetry_feat.join(error_maint_feat, \n                                  ((telemetry_feat['machineID'] == error_maint_feat['machineID']) \n                                   &amp; (telemetry_feat['dt_truncated'] == error_maint_feat['dt_truncated'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n              .drop(error_maint_feat.machineID).drop(error_maint_feat.dt_truncated))\n```\n\n# Label construction\n\nPredictive maintenance is supervised learning. To train a model to predict failures requires examples of failures, and the time series of observations leading up to those failures. Additionally, the model needs examples of periods of healthy operation in order to discern the difference between the two states. The classification between these states is typically a boolean label (healthy vs failed).\n\nOnce we have the healthy vs. failure states, the predictive maintenance approach is only useful if the method will give some advanced warning of an impending failure. To accomplish this _prior warning_ criteria, we slightly modify the label definition from a _failure event_ which occurs at a specific moment in time, to a longer window of _failure event occurs within this window_. The window length is defined by the business criteria. Is knowing a failure will occur within 12 hours, enough time to prevent the failure from happening? Is 24 hours, or 2 weeks? The ability of the model to accurately predict an impending failure is dependent sizing this window. If the failure signal is short, longer windows will not help, and can actually degrade, the potential performance.   \n\nTo acheive the redefinition of failure to _about to fail_, we over label failure events, labeling all observations within the failure warning window as failed. The prediction problem then becomes estimating the probability of failure within this window. For this example scenerio, we estimate the probability that a machine will fail in the near future due to a failure of a certain component. More specifically, the goal is to compute the probability that a machine will fail in the next 7 days due to a component failure (component 1, 2, 3, or 4). \n\n![Data Labeling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance/master/images/labelling-for-binary-classification.png)\n\nBelow, a categorical failure feature is created to serve as the label. All records within a 24 hour window before a failure of component 1 have failure=\&quot;comp1\&quot;, and so on for components 2, 3, and 4; all records not within 7 days of a component failure have failure=\&quot;none\&quot;.\n\nThe first step is to align the failure data to the feature observation time points (every 12 hours).\n\n```\nfailures = spark.table(FAILURE_DATA).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) <= TO_DATE).where(F.col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;) > START_DATE) .cache()\n\n# We need to redefine dt_truncated to align with the failures table\ndt_truncated = ((round(unix_timestamp(col(\&quot;datetime\&quot;)) / time_val) * time_val).cast(\&quot;timestamp\&quot;))\n\nfail_diff = (failures.withColumn(\&quot;dt_truncated\&quot;, dt_truncated)\n             .drop(failures.datetime))\n```\n\nNext, we convert the labels from text to numeric values. In the end, this will transform the problem from boolean of 'healthy'/'impending failure' to a multiclass 'healthy'/'component `n` impending failure'.\n\n```\n# map the failure data to final feature matrix\nlabeled_features = (final_feat.join(fail_diff, \n                                    ((final_feat['machineID'] == fail_diff['machineID']) \n                                     &amp; (final_feat['dt_truncated'] == fail_diff['dt_truncated'])), \&quot;left\&quot;)\n                    .drop(fail_diff.machineID).drop(fail_diff.dt_truncated)\n                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == \&quot;comp1\&quot;, 1.0).otherwise(col('failure')))\n                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == \&quot;comp2\&quot;, 2.0).otherwise(col('failure')))\n                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == \&quot;comp3\&quot;, 3.0).otherwise(col('failure')))\n                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == \&quot;comp4\&quot;, 4.0).otherwise(col('failure'))))\n\nlabeled_features = (labeled_features.withColumn(\&quot;failure\&quot;, \n                                                labeled_features.failure.cast(DoubleType()))\n                    .fillna(0))\n```\n\nTo now, we have labels as _failure events_.

The `./notebooks/2b_model_building` notebook works through building either a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier using this data set.\n\n&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vikp/clean_notebooks_filtered&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:18,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Core Value: Collaboration and Community\n\nLesson: How to Contribute to OpenStreetMap\n\nIntroduction:\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project that relies on contributions from people like you to create and maintain a free map of the world. In this lesson, we will learn how to contribute to OSM by adding new data, editing existing data, and sharing our knowledge with others.\n\nSection 1: Adding New Data\n\nTheoretical Concepts:\n- Nodes: points on the map\n- Ways: lines on the map\n- Relations: areas on the map\n\nPractical Examples:\n1. Add a new restaurant to the map by creating a node for its location and adding tags to describe it (e.g., \&quot;name=Restaurant XYZ\&quot;).\n2. Draw a new bike path by creating a way that connects multiple nodes and adding tags to describe the path (e.g., \&quot;bicycle=yes\&quot;).\n3. Create a new park by drawing a polygon around it using a relation and adding tags to describe the park (e.g., \&quot;leisure=park\&quot;).\n\nSection 2: Editing Existing Data\n\nTheoretical Concepts:\n- Changeset: a collection of edits made to the map\n- Revision: a historical version of the map\n\nPractical Examples:\n1. Correct a misspelled street name by editing the node and way tags.\n2. Close a gap in a road by connecting two adjacent ways.\n3. Remove a duplicate node from a major route by deleting it and merging the ways.\n\nSection 3: Sharing Knowledge\n\nTheoretical Concepts:\n- Talk: a discussion forum for mapping questions and ideas\n- Wiki: a collection of documentation and guides for mapping tools and techniques\n\nPractical Examples:\n1. Ask a question about mapping techniques or software on the talk forum.\n2. Contribute to the wiki by writing guides or updating existing documentation.\n3. Organize a local mapping party to bring together members of the community and improve the map in your area.\n\nConclusion:\nBy contributing to OpenStreetMap, you are helping to create a free and open map of the world that can be used by anyone. Whether you are adding new data, editing existing data, or sharing your knowledge with others, your contributions make a difference. Apply the skills you have learned in this lesson to new problems and continue to improve the map for everyone.\n\nGlossary:\n- Node: a point on the map\n- Way: a line on the map\n- Relation: an area on the map\n- Changeset: a collection of edits made to the map\n- Revision: a historical version of the map\n- Talk: a discussion forum for mapping questions and ideas\n- Wiki: a collection of documentation and guides for mapping tools and techniques&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:19,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Multi-swarm PSO and its application in operational optimization of ethylene cracking furnace\n\nThe exiting PSO algorithms are analyzed deeply, a multi-swarm PSO (MSPSO) is studied. The whole swarm is divided into three sub-swarms randomly, the first particle group obeys the standard PSO principle to search the optimal result, the second searches randomly inner neighborhood of the optimal result, the third does not care about the optimal result but flies freely according to themselves velocities and positions. So the algorithm enhances its global searching space, enriches particlespsila diversity in order to let particles jump out local optimization points. Testing and comparing results with standard PSO and linearly decreasing weight PSO by several widely used benchmark functions show optimization performance of the algorithm is better. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is employed to resolve the operational optimization problems of ethylene cracking furnace. The operational optimization results for built cracking model are effective and satisfying.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;High voltage breakdown studies in electron gun and its damage control\n\nVacuum breakdown is a very common problem during the operation of any electron gun. Arcing occurs due to high voltage break down of cathode - anode gap. This not only spoils the job, it also causes lot of damage to the electronic component of the system and damage to the emitter. In this work, a detailed study of the cause of the high voltage breakdown in the gun in the electron beam evaporation system, analysis of the electrical parameters of arc discharge inside the electron gun due to high voltage break down and suitable solution to the arc discharge problem has been presented. Power supplies need to be protected against surges arising out of high voltage breakdown. Ferrite beads have been used to suppress the high frequency content of the breakdown signal. High frequency content of the signal in the MHz range can be attenuated to lower range of KHz by use of ferrite bead thereby protecting against high frequency surges. On the other hand during breakdown there is a sudden increase in the current which needs to be limited without interruption in the process. Possible use of superconductor as fault current limiter has been analyzed in this work.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:21,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;import numpy as np\nimport math\n\n# bezier curve\ndef bernstein(n, i, t):\n    ncr = math.factorial(n) / (math.factorial(i) * math.factorial((n - i)))\n    return ncr * t**i * (1 - t)**(n-i)\n\ndef bezier(n, t, q):\n    p = np.zeros(2)\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        p += bernstein(n, i, t) * q[i]\n    return p\n\n&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Locutusque/prepared-automathtext&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:22,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Book Title: Shifting Currents\nAuthor: L.M. Brown\n\nDescription:\nShifting Currents is a captivating novel that explores the complexities of human relationships and the impact of personal choices on one's destiny. The story follows the journey of two sisters, Lily and Rose, as they navigate through the ups and downs of life. Lily, the elder sister, is a successful businesswoman who seems to have it all, but her seemingly perfect life is shattered when she discovers a shocking secret about her husband. On the other hand, Rose, the younger sister, has always lived in the shadows of her sister's success, but she finds solace in her art. However, her passion for painting leads her down a dangerous path that threatens to destroy her family. As the sisters grapple with their respective challenges, they must learn to trust each other and lean on their faith to overcome the obstacles in their way.\n\n1. Basics (Genre, Premise, Key Takeaways)\nShifting Currents falls under the genre of contemporary fiction. The premise of the book revolves around the theme of sisterhood, betrayal, and redemption. The key takeaways from the book include the importance of trust, forgiveness, and the power of faith. The author skillfully weaves these themes into the narrative, making them relevant and relatable to the reader.\n\n2. Characters or Key Figures\nLily and Rose are the two main characters in the book. Lily is portrayed as a strong and independent woman who appears to have it all. However, her seemingly perfect life is shattered when she discovers that her husband, James, has been leading a double life. This revelation forces Lily to confront her own insecurities and weaknesses, and she must learn to trust herself and others. Rose, on the other hand, is the artistic and sensitive sister who struggles with her own demons. Her passion for painting leads her down a dangerous path, and she must learn to balance her art with her responsibilities to her family.\n\n3. Major Themes (Ideas, Arguments, Approaches, Solutions)\nOne of the major themes of the book is the importance of trust. Lily's discovery of James' infidelity forces her to question her own trust in him and in herself. She must learn to trust herself and others, even in the face of adversity. This theme is also reflected in Rose's relationship with her husband, who becomes increasingly distant as her art takes over her life. Rose must learn to trust her husband and herself, and she must find a way to balance her art with her responsibilities to her family.\n\nAnother major theme of the book is forgiveness. Lily must learn to forgive James for his betrayal, and she must learn to forgive herself for her own mistakes. Rose must learn to forgive herself for her own shortcomings and for the pain she has caused her family. Forgiveness is a powerful force that can heal wounds and restore relationships, and the author explores this theme in depth throughout the book.\n\nThe power of faith is another major theme of the book. Lily and Rose both turn to their faith during times of crisis, and they find strength and comfort in their beliefs. Faith provides them with a sense of hope and purpose, and it helps them to overcome the obstacles in their way. The author explores the role of faith in a modern world, and she shows how it can provide comfort and guidance in times of need.\n\n4. Top 5 helpful advices from the book\n1.

Make things right by taking action to repair the damage that has been done.\n5. Move forward. Let go of the past and focus on the future. Forgiveness is a process, not a destination, and it requires ongoing effort and commitment.\n\n7. Reasoning (Q&amp;A or Interview)\nInterviewer: Lily, you seem to have it all - a successful career, a loving husband, and a happy family. But your life is turned upside down when you discover James' infidelity. How did you cope with this betrayal?\nLily: It was a difficult time for me. I felt betrayed and hurt, and I struggled to come to terms with what had happened. But I realized that I couldn't let James' actions define our relationship. I had to learn to trust myself and others, and I had to find a way to move forward.\nInterviewer: How did you learn to trust again?\nLily: It wasn't easy, but I started by focusing on my own strengths and weaknesses. I realized that I couldn't control James' actions, but I could control my own. I also sought the support of my friends and family, and I leaned on my faith to provide me with strength and guidance.\nInterviewer: Rose, your passion for painting leads you down a dangerous path. How did you cope with the pressure to succeed?\nRose: It was a difficult time for me. I felt overwhelmed by the expectations of others, and I struggled to find a way to balance my art with my responsibilities to my family. But I realized that I couldn't let my passion consume me. I had to learn to balance my art with my responsibilities, and I had to find a way to communicate openly and honestly with my loved ones.\nInterviewer: How did you learn to communicate openly and honestly with your loved ones?\nRose: It wasn't easy, but I started by acknowledging the hurt that I had caused.

Lily was older and very successful, while Rose was younger and more artistic. They both loved each other very much, but they faced many challenges along the way. One day, Lily discovered that her husband, James, had been leading a double life. She was very hurt and didn't know what to do. But she realized that she couldn't let James' actions define their relationship. She learned to trust herself and others, and she found a way to move forward. Rose, on the other hand, struggled with her own demons. Her passion for painting led her down a dangerous path, and she found herself in trouble. But she realized that she couldn't let her passion consume her. She learned to balance her art with her responsibilities, and she found a way to communicate openly and honestly with her loved ones.

In this paper, we describe the application of an automated technique for macromodel extraction. Called TVP, the technique works directly from detailed transistor-level descriptions (e.g., SPICE) of a block to produce system-level macromodels (e.g., suitable for MATLAB). A key property of TVP is that it can reduce blocks with switching, sampling or frequency-translation properties. MP is efficient for large circuits and can automatically tailor the size of the macromodel to meet a specified accuracy. TVP also produces dominant poles and zeros without need for lengthy simulations. We present applications to RF mixers and switched-capacitor filters, to obtain size reductions of more than two orders of magnitude with no appreciable loss of accuracy.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:24,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Book Title: Pedagogy And Professional Responsibilities Ec-12 (160)\nAuthor: Beatrice Mendez Newman\nDescription: This book provides an overview of the pedagogical and professional responsibilities of educators in grades K-12.

Pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller\n\nChapter 1: The Importance of Classroom Management\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land filled with students, there was a teacher named Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith knew that in order to create a positive learning environment, he needed to manage his classroom effectively. He set clear expectations for his students, organized his classroom space, and managed student behavior. As a result, his students were able to focus on learning and thrive in his classroom.\n\nChapter 2: Differentiated Instruction\n\nOne day, Mr. Smith met a wise teacher named Ms. Johnson. She told him about the importance of differentiating instruction to meet the diverse needs of his students. Mr. Smith decided to try this new approach, and he found that his students were more engaged and successful in their learning.\n\nChapter 3: Assessment and Feedback\n\nAs the school year went on, Mr. Smith realized the importance of assessment and feedback. He developed a system for assessing his students' progress and providing meaningful feedback. His students felt more supported and motivated to learn, and their academic performance improved.\n\nAnd so, Mr. Smith continued to grow as an educator, always striving to improve his teaching practices and better serve his students. And they all lived happily ever after.\n&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:25,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Lesson: Myocardial Bridges - Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Significance\n\nIntroduction:\nMyocardial bridges are a common anatomical variation in which a segment of the myocardium extends into the epicardial coronary artery. This bridge can compress the artery during systole, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially causing ischemia. In this lesson, we will explore the anatomy, physiology, and clinical significance of myocardial bridges.\n\nAnatomy:\nMyocardial bridges are formed when a portion of the myocardial wall is connected to the outer surface of the coronary artery. This connection can occur at any point along the artery, but is most commonly found in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The bridge can vary in length and width, and may be composed of smooth muscle, connective tissue, or both.\n\nPhysiology:\nDuring systole, the heart contracts and the myocardial bridge compresses the epicardial coronary artery. This compression can reduce blood flow to the myocardium supplied by that artery, leading to ischemia. The degree of compression and the resulting reduction in blood flow can vary depending on the characteristics of the myocardial bridge. Some bridges may cause only mild compression, while others may result in significant reductions in blood flow.\n\nClinical Significance:\nMyocardial bridges are often discovered incidentally during autopsy or imaging studies. In many cases, they do not cause any symptoms or adverse effects on cardiac function. However, in some individuals, myocardial bridges can lead to chest pain, arrhythmias, or even myocardial infarction. The risk of developing symptoms related to a myocardial bridge is generally higher in individuals with other coronary artery abnormalities or risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\nDiagnosis:\nMyocardial bridges can be diagnosed using a variety of imaging techniques, including angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can help determine the location, size, and characteristics of the myocardial bridge, as well as assess its impact on coronary blood flow.\n\nTreatment:\nIn most cases, myocardial bridges do not require treatment. However, in individuals with symptoms related to the bridge, treatment may involve medication to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms, or interventional procedures to improve blood flow to the affected myocardium.\n\nConclusion:\nMyocardial bridges are a common anatomical variation that can compress the epicardial coronary artery during systole, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially causing ischemia. While many myocardial bridges do not cause symptoms, they can contribute to chest pain, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction in some individuals. Diagnosis and treatment of myocardial bridges typically involve imaging studies and interventional procedures, depending on the severity of symptoms.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/tiny-strange-textbooks&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:26,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Application of η-expansion technique to the φ3-theory in arbitrary dimension\n\nThe [Formula: see text]-theory in the Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension is considered in the present paper.

However, the book does provide insights into Swift's songwriting process and the stories behind some of her most popular songs.\n\n3. Major Themes (Ideas, Arguments, Approaches, Solutions)\nWhile this book is not necessarily focused on major themes, it does touch on some ideas and approaches related to music and learning. For example, the book emphasizes the importance of practice and consistency in improving piano skills. It also encourages students to listen closely to the original songs and try to capture the essence of the melody and rhythm in their own playing.\n\n- In terms of alignment with Christian doctrine, some of Swift's songs do touch on themes of faith and spirituality. For example, \&quot;Fearless\&quot; includes the lyrics \&quot;I'm fearless, I'm powerful, I'm unstoppable, I'm a champion\&quot; which could be interpreted as having a spiritual or inspirational meaning. However, overall, this book is not explicitly religious in nature.\n\n4. Top 5 helpful advices from the book\n1. Start slow: When learning a new song, it's important to start at a slower tempo and gradually increase speed as comfort level improves.\n2. Focus on accuracy: Rather than rushing through a song, prioritize accuracy and precision in playing each note correctly.\n3. Use both hands: Many of Swift's songs feature complex chord progressions that require the use of both hands. Practice switching between chords smoothly and fluidly.\n4. Listen to the original: To truly capture the essence of a song, it's important to listen closely to the original recording and try to replicate the melody and rhythm as closely as possible.\n5. Be patient: Learning to play the piano takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if progress seems slow at first. Keep at it, and eventually, skills will improve.\n\n5.

Such pitch-to-pitch variation of vowels is studied in the light of nonlinear dynamics. For the analysis, five normal vowels recorded from three male and two female subjects are exploited, where the vowel signals are shown to have normal levels of the pitch-to-pitch variation. First, by the false nearest-neighbor analysis, nonlinear dynamics of the vowels are shown to be well analyzed by using a relatively low-dimensional reconstructing dimension of 4 < or = d < or = 7. Then, we further studied nonlinear dynamics of the vowels by spike-and-wave surrogate analysis. The results imply that there exists nonlinear dynamical correlation between one pitch-waveform pattern to another in the vowel signals. On the basis of the analysis results, applicability of the nonlinear prediction technique to vowel synthesis is discussed.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:30,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;#### keras part - feature gathering\n\n```\nfrom keras.preprocessing import image\nfrom keras.applications.inception_resnet_v2 import InceptionResNetV2\nfrom keras.applications.inception_resnet_v2 import preprocess_input,decode_predictions\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\nThis loads an image and resizes the image to (224, 224):\n\n img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))\nThe img_to_array() function adds channels: x.shape = (224, 224, 3) for RGB and (224, 224, 1) for gray image\n\n x = image.img_to_array(img) \nexpand_dims() is used to add the number of images: x.shape = (1, 224, 224, 3):\n\nInput is a tensor with shape (number of images) x (image width) x (image height) x (image depth).\n\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\npreprocess_input subtracts the mean RGB channels of the imagenet dataset.

Cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and illegal drug use are common among university students. Hence, the aim of this study was assessment of the attitude toward substance use and its predictors among final year medical students, faculty of medicine, Cairo University. Materials and Methods: In total, 200 students were randomly chosen during their final year of study. Participants were subjected to semistructured questions that assessed demographics and smoking status of the students, attitude toward substance abuse questionnaire, and Sensation-seeking Scale (SSS). Results: Male individuals comprised 61% compared with 39% of female individuals, and the age for both male students and female students ranged from 21 to 31 years old with a mean value of 23.21±1.09. The majority (95%) did not use substances, whereas 5% used substances at least once during their life. About half of the students (52.5%) scored average on the SSS, whereas 28% scored low and 19% were high on the scale. Comparison between both sexes revealed a significant difference in smoking (P<0.001). Both sexes did not differ in the attitude toward substance abuse and the SSS (P=0.37 and 0.20, respectively). Smokers showed significantly higher scores on attitude toward substance abuse (P<0.001) and also the students who had lifetime substance use (P<0.001). Conclusions: Smoking and substance use are more important than age and sex as predictors of attitude of medical students toward substance use.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:34,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Prediction of glaucomatous visual field loss by extrapolation of linear trends.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo investigate how well short-term progression rates can predict long-term visual field outcomes in patients with glaucoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe calculated visual field rates of progression using linear regression analysis of the Visual Field Index (VFI) for 100 consecutive patients with glaucoma having 10 or more Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm standard field tests. Final VFI was predicted on the basis of linear extrapolation of the slope defined by the initial 5 field test results. Final VFI also was estimated using linear regression of all qualifying examination results for each patient. Primary outcome measures were the absolute difference and the correlation between predicted and estimated final VFI values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatient follow-up averaged 8.2 years and 11 field examinations. Median VFI progression rate was -1.1% per year both for the initial 5 test results and also for the complete series. Seventy percent of patients had a predicted final VFI within +/-10% of the estimated final VFI, and the 2 VFI calculations had a correlation coefficient of 0.84.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLinear extrapolation based on 5 initial visual field test results was a reliable predictor of future field loss in most patients. Patients in whom linear regression analysis suggests dangerously rapid rates of visual field progression may be candidates for significant alterations in therapy.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:35,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Lesson: Introduction to Baroque Architecture\n\n### Section 1: Theoretical Concepts\nBaroque architecture is a style of building that emerged in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.

This study applies a low-cost single camera system to locate and identify traffic signs and reflects their on-site conditions for assisting in maintenance. Referring to official regulations, a traffic sign can be identified and classified based on its color and shape attributes. The poses and states of the sign planes can also be evaluated according to their geometric shape ratios and the discrepancy with respect to traffic sign regulations, in which a least-square consistency check is proposed to ensure assessment reliability and accuracy. Validation with day and nighttime image sequences was performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the robustness to illumination changes, color deterioration, and motion blur. Considering the promising results, this study can be deemed as an alternative to promote routine maintenance of traffic facilities.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:37,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;import cv2\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\nimage_path='C:\\\\Users\\\\Glen\\\\Pictures\\\\modi.jpg'\n\nimg=cv2.imread(image_path,0)\n\n#inverse\nnegative=abs(cv2.subtract(255,img))\n\n#log transforms\n\nc=255/(1+np.log(np.max(img)))\nlogtransform=(c*np.log(1+img))\nlogtransform=np.array(logtransform,dtype=np.uint8)\n\n\n#gamma\ngamma=1.5\n\ngammatransform=np.array(255*(img/255)**gamma,dtype=np.uint8)\n\n\ncv2.imshow(\&quot;Original\&quot;,img)\ncv2.imshow(\&quot;Negative\&quot;,negative)\ncv2.imshow(\&quot;Log\&quot;,logtransform)\ncv2.imshow(\&quot;Gamma\&quot;,gammatransform)\n\n\n\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Locutusque/prepared-automathtext&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:38,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;from func.tg_bot import *\nimport numpy as np\n\n@bot.message_handler(content_types=[\&quot;text\&quot;])\ndef repeat_all_messages(message):\n\tt = message.text.split('\\n')\n\ttry:\n\t\tx_shape = tuple(map(int, t[0].split()))\n\t\tX = np.fromiter(map(int, t[1].split()), np.int).reshape(x_shape)\n\t\ty_shape = tuple(map(int, t[2].split()))\n\t\tY = np.fromiter(map(int, t[3].split()), np.int).reshape(y_shape)\n\t\tif x_shape[1]==y_shape[1]:\n\t\t\tte = ''\n\t\t\tfor i in X.dot(Y.T):\n\t\t\t\tfor j in i:\n\t\t\t\t\tte += str(j) + ' '\n\t\t\t\tte += '\\n'\n\t\t\tbot.send_message(message.chat.id, te)\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\tbot.send_message(message.chat.id, 'matrix shapes do not match')\n\texcept:\n\t\tbot.send_message(message.chat.id, 'Error!')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\tbot.polling(none_stop=True)\n&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Locutusque/prepared-automathtext&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:39,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;text&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;1.

The environment has been polluted with an increase of greenhouse gases. The major consequences are global warming, cyclone, an increase in sea level, etc. It has a clear negative impact on the natural environment including aquatic ones. As a result, production of fish in the aquaculture system and marine system is greatly affected. Marine ecosystems like coral reefs are also destroyed. Decreased fish production has also affected the livelihood and economic condition of the fish farmers. So, corrective measures should be taken to reduce the climate changes for minimizing its effects on fish production. Using more eco-friendly substances, planting more trees, and preserving our nature are some steps to be taken. Awareness should also be generated among the common people.&quot;},&quot;source&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;nampdn-ai/mini-peS2o&quot;}}}],&quot;truncated&quot;:true},&quot;paginationData&quot;:{&quot;pageIndex&quot;:0,&quot;numItemsPerPage&quot;:100,&quot;numTotalItems&quot;:3220278,&quot;offset&quot;:0,&quot;length&quot;:100}},&quot;jwt&quot;:&quot;eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.eyJyZWFkIjp0cnVlLCJvbkJlaGFsZk9mIjp7Il9pZCI6IjY1OGJkNmU4NWM2ZmI1ZDVlMzJiYWYwMCIsInVzZXIiOiJhbm90aGVycyJ9LCJpYXQiOjE3MTAzMzM0NTgsInN1YiI6Ii9kYXRhc2V0cy9Mb2N1dHVzcXVlL1VsdHJhVGV4dGJvb2tzLTIuMCIsImV4cCI6MTcxMDMzMzYzOCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9odWdnaW5nZmFjZS5jbyJ9.uoInx48BhA00X-Cod2IvuTmNc0IUngweb-NdBxXFgaQi1gzPR9TX8Ev0O0pW7RrGmab6kGDQp_2s5AmCjwwPAQ&quot;,&quot;displayUrls&quot;:true},&quot;dataset&quot;:&quot;Locutusque/UltraTextbooks-2.0&quot;,&quot;isGated&quot;:false,&quot;isPrivate&quot;:false,&quot;author&quot;:{&quot;avatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://aeiljuispo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/noauth/YeFyz1AZVcCRsyNHHtwJG.jpeg?w=200&amp;h=200&amp;f=face&quot;,&quot;fullname&quot;:&quot;Sebastian Gabarain&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Locutusque&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;isPro&quot;:false,&quot;isHf&quot;:false},&quot;compact&quot;:true}" data-target="DatasetViewer"><div class="px-2.5 mx-auto mb-10 rounded-lg border pt-2 shadow-sm "><div class="mb-2 flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2 sm:gap-2.5"><div class="mr-auto flex items-center"><svg class="mr-1 flex-none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 12 12"><path fill="currentColor" d="M2.5 2h7a1 1 0 0 1 1 1v6a1 1 0 0 1-1 1h-7a1 1 0 0 1-1-1V3a1 1 0 0 1 1-1Zm0 2v2h3V4h-3Zm4 0v2h3V4h-3Zm-4 3v2h3V7h-3Zm4 0v2h3V7h-3Z"></path></svg>

# Basic syntax and data types in Erlang

Erlang is a functional programming language that was developed by Ericsson in the 1980s. It was designed for building large distributed and fault-tolerant Telecom applications. Today, Erlang is used in a variety of applications, including servers, distributed systems, and financial systems.

In this section, we will cover the basic syntax and data types in Erlang. Understanding the syntax and data types is crucial for writing correct and efficient Erlang code.

Erlang programs are written in a high-level declarative language. Compared to imperative programming languages like Java or C, Erlang programs are usually more concise and shorter in terms of coding lines. This makes Erlang a productive language for software development.

One of the key features of Erlang is its support for concurrency. Erlang uses a message passing paradigm, allowing lightweight concurrent processes to communicate with each other without the need to share memory. This makes Erlang well-suited for multi-core environments and offers a higher level of abstraction for synchronization compared to locking mechanisms used in other languages.

Another important feature of Erlang is its support for distribution. Erlang is designed to be run in a distributed environment, with an Erlang system consisting of a network of Erlang nodes. Processes running on different nodes can communicate with each other in the same way as processes on the same node.

Erlang also provides robustness through its exception detection and recovery mechanism. It supports catch/throw-style exceptions and offers a supervision feature, where a process can register as a supervisor for another process and receive notifications if the supervised process terminates. The supervisor can then restart the crashed process.

In the next few sections, we will dive deeper into the syntax and data types in Erlang, exploring how to write correct and efficient code.

Let's take a look at a simple Erlang program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```erlang
-module(hello_world).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    io:format("Hello, World!~n").
```

In this example, we define a module called `hello_world` and export a function called `start`. The `start` function uses the `io:format` function to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Exercise
Write an Erlang program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

### Solution
```erlang
-module(factorial).
-export([calculate_factorial/1]).

calculate_factorial(0) ->
    1;
calculate_factorial(N) ->
    N * calculate_factorial(N-1).
```

# Understanding the principles of OTP design

OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of libraries and design principles that provide a framework for building fault-tolerant and scalable applications in Erlang. OTP is widely used in the Erlang community and has proven to be effective in building robust systems.

In this section, we will explore the principles of OTP design and how they can be applied to maximize Erlang performance. Understanding these principles is essential for developing efficient and reliable Erlang applications.

A fundamental concept in OTP design is the supervision tree. The supervision tree is a hierarchical arrangement of code into supervisors and workers. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the behavior of workers and can restart them if something goes wrong. This hierarchical structure allows for the design and programming of fault-tolerant software.

In OTP, behaviors are formalizations of common patterns found in supervision trees. Behaviors divide the code for a process into a generic part (a behavior module) and a specific part (a callback module). The behavior module is part of Erlang/OTP and provides a set of pre-defined functions, while the callback module is implemented by the user and exports the necessary callback functions.

Let's consider an example of a simple server in Erlang. The server keeps track of a number of "channels" and allows other processes to allocate and free these channels.

```erlang
-module(channel_server).
-behavior(gen_server).

-export([start_link/0]).
-export([alloc/0, free/1]).

start_link() ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, [], []).

alloc() ->
    gen_server:call(?MODULE, alloc).

free(Channel) ->
    gen_server:cast(?MODULE, {free, Channel}).

init([]) ->
    {ok, []}.

handle_call(alloc, _From, State) ->
    {reply, {ok, Channel}, [Channel | State]}.

handle_cast({free, Channel}, State) ->
    {noreply, lists:delete(Channel, State), State}.

handle_info(_Info, State) ->
    {noreply, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.
```

In this example, we define a behavior module called `gen_server` and implement the necessary callback functions in the callback module. The server keeps track of the allocated channels in its state and responds to `alloc` and `free` requests from other processes.

## Exercise
Consider the example of the channel server. How would you modify the code to handle the case where all channels have been allocated and there are no available channels to allocate?

### Solution
You can modify the `handle_call` function to check if there are any available channels before allocating a new one. If there are no available channels, you can reply with an error message instead.

```erlang
handle_call(alloc, _From, State) ->
    case available_channels(State) of
        [] ->
            {reply, {error, no_channels_available}, State};
        [Channel | Rest] ->
            {reply, {ok, Channel}, [Channel | Rest]}
    end.

available_channels(State) ->
    lists:subtract(all_channels(), State).

all_channels() ->
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. % Example list of available channels
```

# Designing for scalability and fault tolerance



One important principle to keep in mind when designing for scalability is the idea of horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to a system to handle increased load, rather than relying on a single machine to handle all the traffic. In Erlang, this can be achieved by distributing processes across multiple nodes in a network.

To design for fault tolerance, it is important to understand the concept of supervision trees. Supervision trees provide a hierarchical structure for organizing processes, where supervisors monitor the behavior of worker processes and can restart them if they fail. This allows for the isolation of failures and the ability to recover from them quickly.

Let's consider an example of designing for fault tolerance in a chat application. The application consists of multiple chat rooms, each managed by a separate process. If a chat room process crashes, it should be restarted automatically without affecting the other chat rooms.

```erlang
-module(chat_room).
-behavior(supervisor).

-export([start_link/0]).
-export([create_room/1]).

start_link() ->
    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).

create_room(RoomId) ->
    supervisor:start_child(?MODULE, [RoomId]).

init([]) ->
    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, []}}.

%% Callback functions for supervisor behavior

child_spec([RoomId]) ->
    {chat_room_process, {chat_room_process, start_link, [RoomId]}, temporary, 5000, worker, [chat_room_process]}.

%% Callback functions for worker behavior

start_link(RoomId) ->
    spawn_link(fun() -> loop(RoomId) end).

loop(RoomId) ->
    receive
        {join, User} ->
            io:format("User ~p joined room ~p~n", [User, RoomId]),
            loop(RoomId);
        {leave, User} ->
            io:format("User ~p left room ~p~n", [User, RoomId]),
            loop(RoomId);
        {message, User, Message} ->
            io:format("User ~p sent message ~p in room ~p~n", [User, Message, RoomId]),
            loop(RoomId)
    end.
```

In this example, we define a supervisor module called `chat_room` that manages multiple chat room processes. Each chat room process is responsible for handling join, leave, and message events in a specific chat room. If a chat room process crashes, the supervisor will automatically restart it.

## Exercise
Consider the example of the chat application. How would you modify the code to handle the case where a chat room process exceeds a certain threshold of errors and needs to be permanently terminated?

### Solution
You can modify the supervisor's `init` function to specify a maximum restart intensity for the chat room processes. Once a chat room process exceeds the maximum restart intensity, it will be permanently terminated.

```erlang
init([]) ->
    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [{chat_room_process, {chat_room_process, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, worker, [chat_room_process]}]}}.
```

In this example, we set the maximum restart intensity to 5, which means that a chat room process will be restarted at most 5 times within a 10-second period. If it exceeds this threshold, it will be permanently terminated.

# The role of supervision trees in Erlang



At the core of a supervision tree are two types of processes: supervisors and workers. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the behavior of worker processes and taking appropriate actions in case of failures. Workers, on the other hand, are the actual processes that perform computations or handle specific tasks.

Supervisors are organized in a tree-like structure, where each supervisor can have multiple child processes. This hierarchical arrangement allows for the isolation of failures and the ability to recover from them quickly. If a worker process crashes, its supervisor can restart it, ensuring that the system remains operational.

Let's consider an example of a supervision tree in a web server application. The application consists of multiple worker processes, each responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. The supervisor for the web server is responsible for monitoring the behavior of these worker processes and restarting them if they fail.

```erlang
-module(web_server_supervisor).
-behavior(supervisor).

-export([start_link/0]).
-export([init/1]).

start_link() ->
    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).

init([]) ->
    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [{web_server_worker, {web_server_worker, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, worker, [web_server_worker]}]}}.
```

In this example, we define a supervisor module called `web_server_supervisor` that manages the web server worker processes. The supervisor's `init` function specifies the restart strategy (one_for_one), maximum restart intensity (5), and maximum restart time (10 seconds). It also defines the child specification for the worker processes.

## Exercise
Consider the example of the web server application. How would you modify the code to add a second level of supervisors that manage groups of worker processes?

### Solution
To add a second level of supervisors, you can modify the supervisor's `init` function to include child specifications for the second level supervisors. Each second level supervisor can then have its own set of worker processes that it monitors.

```erlang
init([]) ->
    {ok, {{one_for_one, 5, 10}, [
        {web_server_worker_supervisor_1, {web_server_worker_supervisor_1, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, supervisor, [web_server_worker_supervisor_1]},
        {web_server_worker_supervisor_2, {web_server_worker_supervisor_2, start_link, []}, permanent, 5000, supervisor, [web_server_worker_supervisor_2]}
    ]}}.
```

In this example, we add two second level supervisors (`web_server_worker_supervisor_1` and `web_server_worker_supervisor_2`) to the supervisor tree. Each second level supervisor can have its own set of worker processes that it monitors.

# Maximizing performance through process management



One important aspect of process management is process creation and termination. Creating and terminating processes in Erlang is lightweight and efficient, but it's still important to minimize unnecessary process creation and termination to avoid unnecessary overhead.

Instead of creating a new process for each individual task, it is often more efficient to use a pool of pre-created processes that can be reused for multiple tasks. This approach reduces the overhead of process creation and termination and improves overall system performance.

Let's consider an example of a task scheduler in an Erlang application. Instead of creating a new process for each task, we can create a pool of worker processes that are responsible for executing tasks. When a new task arrives, it can be assigned to an available worker process from the pool.

```erlang
-module(task_scheduler).
-export([start/0, schedule_task/1]).

start() ->
    PoolSize = 10,
    Pool = start_worker_processes(PoolSize),
    loop(Pool).

start_worker_processes(N) ->
    lists:map(fun(_) -> spawn_link(fun() -> worker() end) end, lists:seq(1, N)).

loop(Pool) ->
    receive
        {task, Task} ->
            {Worker, NewPool} = get_available_worker(Pool),
            Worker ! {execute, Task},
            loop(NewPool)
    end.

get_available_worker([{Worker, Status} | Rest]) ->
    case Status of
        busy ->
            get_available_worker(Rest);
        available ->
            {Worker, [{Worker, busy} | Rest]}
    end.

worker() ->
    receive
        {execute, Task} ->
            % Execute the task
            execute_task(Task),
            % Notify the scheduler that the worker is available
            scheduler ! {worker_available, self()}
    end,
    worker().

execute_task(Task) ->
    % Perform the task
    ok.
```

In this example, the `start` function initializes a pool of worker processes using the `start_worker_processes` function. The `loop` function receives tasks and assigns them to available worker processes from the pool.

## Exercise
Consider the task scheduler example. How would you modify the code to limit the number of tasks that can be queued at a time?

### Solution
To limit the number of tasks that can be queued at a time, you can add a maximum queue size parameter to the `loop` function and check the queue size before accepting a new task. If the queue size exceeds the maximum, you can either reject the task or implement a queuing strategy such as dropping the oldest task in the queue.

```erlang
loop(MaxQueueSize, Queue, Pool) ->
    receive
        {task, Task} when length(Queue) &lt; MaxQueueSize ->
            {Worker, NewPool} = get_available_worker(Pool),
            Worker ! {execute, Task},
            loop(MaxQueueSize, [Task | Queue], NewPool)
    end.
```

In this modified version of the `loop` function, the maximum queue size is passed as a parameter, and the queue size is checked before accepting a new task. If the queue size exceeds the maximum, the task is not added to the queue.

# Implementing message passing and concurrency in Erlang



In Erlang, processes communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. Message passing is asynchronous, meaning that a process can send a message and continue its execution without waiting for a response. This allows for concurrent execution and efficient use of system resources.

To send a message in Erlang, you use the `!` operator. For example, to send a message containing the atom `hello` to a process with the process identifier `Pid`, you would write `Pid ! hello`.

```erlang
-module(message_passing).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    Pid = spawn(fun() -> receiver() end),
    Pid ! hello.

receiver() ->
    receive
        Message ->
            io:format("Received message: ~p~n", [Message])
    end.
```

In this example, the `start` function spawns a new process that executes the `receiver` function. The `receiver` function waits for a message to be received and then prints the received message to the console.

## Exercise
Modify the `message_passing` module to send multiple messages to the receiver process.

### Solution
```erlang
-module(message_passing).
-export([start/0]).

start() ->
    Pid = spawn(fun() -> receiver() end),
    Pid ! hello,
    Pid ! world.

receiver() ->
    receive
        Message ->
            io:format("Received message: ~p~n", [Message]),
            receiver()
    end.
```

In this modified version of the `message_passing` module, two messages (`hello` and `world`) are sent to the receiver process. The receiver process will print each received message to the console and then wait for another message.

# Utilizing OTP design patterns for performance optimization



One of the key design patterns in OTP is the use of supervisors and workers. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring the behavior of worker processes and restarting them if they fail. This ensures that the application remains operational even in the presence of failures. By properly structuring your application into supervisors and workers, you can maximize performance and fault tolerance.

Another important OTP design pattern is the use of gen_servers. Gen_servers are generic servers that provide a standardized interface for handling requests and maintaining state. By using gen_servers, you can simplify the implementation of concurrent and distributed systems, and improve performance by reducing the overhead of managing state.

In addition to supervisors and gen_servers, OTP provides other design patterns and libraries that can be used to optimize performance. These include gen_fsm (finite state machines), gen_event (event handling), and gen_statem (state machines). By understanding and utilizing these design patterns, you can design and implement high-performance Erlang applications.

```erlang
-module(supervisor_example).
-behaviour(supervisor).

-export([start_link/0, init/1]).

start_link() ->
    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).

init([]) ->
    ChildSpecs = [
        #{id => worker1, start => {worker, start_link, []}},
        #{id => worker2, start => {worker, start_link, []}}
    ],
    {ok, { {one_for_one, 10, 10}, ChildSpecs}}.
```

In this example, we define a supervisor module that starts two worker processes. If any of the worker processes fail, the supervisor will restart them. This ensures that the application remains operational even in the presence of failures.

## Exercise
Modify the `supervisor_example` module to add a third worker process.

### Solution
```erlang
-module(supervisor_example).
-behaviour(supervisor).

-export([start_link/0, init/1]).

start_link() ->
    supervisor:start_link({local, ?MODULE}, ?MODULE, []).

init([]) ->
    ChildSpecs = [
        #{id => worker1, start => {worker, start_link, []}},
        #{id => worker2, start => {worker, start_link, []}},
        #{id => worker3, start => {worker, start_link, []}}
    ],
    {ok, { {one_for_one, 10, 10}, ChildSpecs}}.
```

In this modified version of the `supervisor_example` module, a third worker process (`worker3`) is added to the supervisor. This allows for the supervision of three worker processes instead of two.

# Tools and techniques for measuring and analyzing performance in Erlang



One of the key tools for measuring performance in Erlang is the `erlang:statistics` module. This module provides functions for collecting and retrieving various performance-related statistics, such as memory usage, process counts, and message queue lengths. By using these functions, you can gain insights into the performance characteristics of your application.

Another useful tool for measuring performance is the `fprof` module. This module provides a profiler that can be used to measure the execution time of Erlang functions. By profiling your code, you can identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

In addition to these built-in tools, there are also third-party tools available for measuring and analyzing performance in Erlang. One such tool is `recon`, which provides a set of functions for monitoring and troubleshooting Erlang systems. `recon` includes features such as memory analysis, process inspection, and tracing.

```erlang
-module(performance_example).

-export([fib/1]).

fib(0) -> 0;
fib(1) -> 1;
fib(N) -> fib(N-1) + fib(N-2).
```

In this example, we define a simple Fibonacci function in Erlang. This function calculates the Nth Fibonacci number recursively. However, this implementation is not efficient and can be optimized.

## Exercise
Use the `fprof` module to profile the `fib/1` function and identify areas for optimization.

### Solution
```erlang
1> c(performance_example).
2> fprof:trace([call]).
3> performance_example:fib(20).
4> fprof:analyse().
```

By following these steps, you can profile the `fib/1` function and analyze its performance. The `fprof:trace([call])` function enables tracing of function calls, the `performance_example:fib(20)` function call executes the `fib/1` function, and the `fprof:analyse()` function provides a detailed analysis of the function's performance.

# Best practices for maximizing Erlang performance



One important aspect to consider is the use of processes in Erlang. Processes are lightweight and can be created and terminated quickly. By using processes effectively, you can achieve high concurrency and parallelism, which can greatly improve performance.

Another best practice is to minimize the use of global variables and mutable state. Erlang is designed to be a functional programming language, and immutability is a key principle. By minimizing mutable state, you can avoid issues such as race conditions and improve the performance of your application.

In addition, it is important to optimize memory usage in Erlang. Erlang uses a garbage collector to manage memory, and inefficient memory usage can lead to performance bottlenecks. By minimizing memory allocations and reducing memory fragmentation, you can improve the overall performance of your application.

```erlang
-module(performance_example).

-export([sum_list/1]).

sum_list([]) -> 0;
sum_list([H|T]) -> H + sum_list(T).
```

In this example, we define a function `sum_list/1` that calculates the sum of a list of numbers. However, this implementation is not efficient and can be optimized.

## Exercise
Optimize the `sum_list/1` function to improve its performance.

### Solution
```erlang
-module(performance_example).

-export([sum_list/1]).

sum_list(List) -> sum_list(List, 0).

sum_list([], Acc) -> Acc;
sum_list([H|T], Acc) -> sum_list(T, H + Acc).
```

In this optimized version of the `sum_list/1` function, an accumulator (`Acc`) is used to keep track of the sum. This eliminates the need for recursive function calls and improves the performance of the function.

# Case studies of successful Erlang implementations



One notable case study is the use of Erlang in the telecom industry. Erlang was originally developed by Ericsson for building telecom systems, and it has been widely adopted in this industry. Telecom systems require high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability, which are all strengths of Erlang. Companies such as Ericsson, WhatsApp, and T-Mobile have successfully used Erlang to build robust and reliable telecom systems.

WhatsApp, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, is built on Erlang. Erlang's concurrency model and fault-tolerant design make it a perfect fit for handling the high volume of messages and ensuring reliable delivery. WhatsApp's use of Erlang has allowed it to scale to billions of users while maintaining a high level of performance and reliability.

Another case study is the use of Erlang in the financial industry. Erlang's ability to handle high concurrency and fault tolerance makes it well-suited for financial systems that require real-time processing and high availability. Companies such as Goldman Sachs and Klarna have successfully used Erlang to build high-performance trading systems and payment platforms.

Klarna, a Swedish fintech company, uses Erlang to power its payment platform. Erlang's ability to handle high concurrency and fault tolerance has allowed Klarna to process millions of transactions per day with low latency and high reliability. Erlang's scalability and performance have been key factors in Klarna's success.

## Exercise
Research and find another case study of a successful Erlang implementation. Summarize the case study and explain how Erlang was used to achieve high performance.

### Solution
One example of a successful Erlang implementation is the use of Erlang in the gaming industry. Game developers such as CCP Games, the creators of the popular game EVE Online, have used Erlang to build highly scalable and fault-tolerant game servers. Erlang's lightweight processes and message passing model make it well-suited for handling the high concurrency and real-time communication required in online multiplayer games. By using Erlang, CCP Games has been able to create a highly immersive and seamless gaming experience for millions of players around the world.

# Future developments and advancements in Erlang



One area of future development in Erlang is the improvement of its runtime system. The Erlang runtime system, known as the BEAM, is responsible for executing Erlang code and managing processes. Efforts are being made to optimize the BEAM to improve performance and reduce memory usage. This will allow Erlang to handle even larger workloads and scale more effectively.

One specific improvement being worked on is the implementation of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in the BEAM. JIT compilation can dynamically optimize code at runtime, resulting in faster execution and reduced memory usage. This will further enhance Erlang's performance and make it even more efficient.

Another area of future development is the expansion of Erlang's ecosystem. Erlang has a strong community of developers and a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Efforts are being made to further expand this ecosystem by developing new libraries and tools that make it easier to build and deploy Erlang applications. This will make Erlang even more accessible and attractive to developers.

One example of a new tool being developed is Lasp, a distributed programming model for Erlang. Lasp provides a high-level abstraction for building distributed applications, making it easier to write scalable and fault-tolerant systems. Lasp is being actively developed and has the potential to greatly simplify the development of distributed Erlang applications.

In addition to these technical advancements, there is also ongoing research and development in the field of programming languages and distributed systems that can benefit Erlang. New techniques and concepts are being explored that can further enhance Erlang's capabilities and make it even more powerful and versatile.

One area of research is the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in Erlang. By combining Erlang's concurrency model with machine learning algorithms, it is possible to build intelligent and adaptive systems that can automatically optimize performance and make real-time decisions. This has the potential to revolutionize how Erlang applications are built and operated.

## Exercise
Research and find another future development or advancement in Erlang. Summarize the development or advancement and explain how it can benefit Erlang.

### Solution
One future development in Erlang is the integration of WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for the web that allows code to run in a web browser at near-native speed. By integrating WebAssembly into Erlang, it will be possible to run Erlang code directly in the browser, opening up new possibilities for web applications and enabling the use of Erlang's concurrency model and fault-tolerance in web development. This integration will make it easier to build highly scalable and reliable web applications using Erlang.</div></div>

Introduction:
Gambling is a popular pastime in many countries, including Italy. However, like many other forms of entertainment, it can be addictive if not managed properly. This is why governments have put in place rules and regulations to control the industry and protect consumers from its negative effects. One such regulation is the restriction of gambling advertising, which is aimed at preventing excessive exposure to gambling and minimizing its appeal to minors.

Core Value:
The core value of this lesson is to understand the importance of gambling advertising regulations and how they are implemented to protect consumers.

Section 1: Theoretical Concepts
Topic 1: What are gambling advertising regulations?
Gambling advertising regulations are rules and guidelines set by governments to control the promotion of gambling products and services. They are designed to prevent excessive exposure to gambling and minimize its appeal to minors.

Topic 2: Why are gambling advertising regulations important?
Gambling advertising regulations are important because they help to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, such as addiction and financial harm. They also help to ensure that gambling remains a form of entertainment rather than a necessity.

Section 2: Practical Examples
Topic 1: How are gambling advertising regulations implemented in Italy?
In Italy, gambling advertising regulations are implemented through a set of rules that govern the content and timing of gambling ads. For example, gambling ads are not allowed during programs that are likely to be watched by minors. Additionally, ads must clearly specify the percentage of the payout from the gambling in question.

Topic 2: What are some examples of gambling advertising regulations in Italy?
Some examples of gambling advertising regulations in Italy include:
- Prohibition of gambling ads during programs that are likely to be watched by minors
- Requirement to clearly specify the percentage of the payout from the gambling in question
- Prohibition of ads that create an incentive to gamble or exalt the game

Section 3: Self-Debating Discussions
Topic 1: Are gambling advertising regulations effective?
Gambling advertising regulations can be effective in reducing the appeal of gambling to minors and preventing excessive exposure to gambling. However, they may not be effective in preventing problem gambling among adults who are already addicted to gambling.

Topic 2: Should gambling advertising regulations be stricter?
There are arguments for and against stricter gambling advertising regulations. Some people believe that stricter regulations would reduce the appeal of gambling and prevent more people from becoming addicted. Others argue that stricter regulations would infringe on personal freedoms and could lead to a black market for gambling products and services.

Glossary:
- Gambling: The act of playing games of chance for money or other stakes.
- Regulation: A rule or set of rules that governs behavior or activity.
- Advertising: The promotion of goods or services through various media channels.

Conclusion:
Gambling advertising regulations are an important tool for protecting consumers from the negative effects of gambling. By understanding the principles behind these regulations and how they are implemented, we can make informed decisions about our own gambling habits and help others do the same.</div></div>

Optical wireless communication (OWC) has captivated an increasing interest in academia and industry recently with the widespread deployment of light emitting diodes (LEDs). OWC has been expected to be an appealing alternative to radio frequency (RF) systems due to its distinct advantages that include rich spectrum resources and high communication security. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is employed in OWC to achieve high data rates and bearable inter-symbol interference (ISI). This paper focuses on designing a Flip-OFDM system for OWC. The performance of the Flip-OFDM OWC system is compared with the conventional OWC system employing QAM. From the simulation result, it is clear that the proposed system can provide a tremendous improvement in BER performance and high data rate can also be achieved and is well suited for future 5G applications.</div></div>

H igher education institutions are being challenged to be more responsive, effective, and efficient in the same way American businesses have been challenged over the past two decades (Alexander, 2000; Cullen, Joyce, Hassall, &amp; Broadbent, 2003). As a result, these institutions are attempting to implement many of the same operational and quality improvement methods that have worked successfully in business and industry (Birn­ baum, 1999; Carey, 1998; Fritz, 1993; Xue, 1998). Such organizational improvement efforts are often referred to as Total Quality Management (TQM) practices and include approaches such as benchmarking, Six Sigma programs, and the Baldrige National Quality award criteria. While there have been some successful TQM efforts within higher education, there are also reports that schools have reduced in scope or totally dropped such quality improvement programs. For example, Birnbaum 0999) determined 41% of higher education institutions that had adopted formal quality efforts later discontinued those programs. Klocinski (1999) reports that, of 46 higher education institutions implementing such efforts in 1991, only 17 still had those processes underway in 1996. These results were counter-balanced, however, by an increased number of institutions implementing TQM, from 46 to 155 over the same time period (Klosinski, 1999). Birnbaum (1999) notes that, overall, it is difficult to sift through the various studies to find an accurate answer, but he concludes TQM has not been maintained as an active process in higher education. Researchers have identified many factors that nega­ tively impact the implementation of formal quality efforts in higher education. These include faculty resistance (Albert &amp; Pet-Armacost, 2002; Nixon, Helms, &amp; Williams, 2001), lack of team-based reward systems (Albert &amp; Pet-Armacost, 2002; Fritz, 1993), the difficulty in defining customer and quality, particularly within the academic areas of a university (Lawrence &amp; Sharma, 2002; Nixon et a!, 2001), lack of leadership support (Benson, 2000; Xue, 1998), limited collection of appropriate data (Fritz, 1993), lack of teamwork (Dailey &amp; Bishop, 2003), and overall cultural differences between higher education and business (Albert &amp; Pet-Carmacost, 2002; Birnbaum, 2000; Roopchand, 1997). These negative findings are tempered, however, by researchers' concern that many previous studies have primarily focused on the use of TQM as an institution-wide initiative. The limited successes may not be surprising given that higher education institutions tend to be loosely coupled organizations that have difficulties implementing system-wide improvement processes (Bush, 1995). Loosely coupled organizations are made up of sub-units (e.g., departments) with few commonalities among them; there­ fore, pressures upon one department may not affect the entire organization (Weick, 1979). Within such a loosely coupled, open system, inputs from the external environment</div></div>

Pigmented naphthoquinone derivatives of shikonin are produced at specific times and in specific cells of Lithospermum erythrorhizon roots. Normal pigment development is limited to root hairs and root border cells in hairy roots grown on "noninducing" medium, whereas induction of additional pigment production by abiotic (CuSO4) or biotic (fungal elicitor) factors increases the amount of total pigment, changes the ratios of derivatives produced, and initiates production of pigment de novo in epidermal cells. When the biological activity of these compounds was tested against soil-borne bacteria and fungi, a wide range of sensitivity was recorded. Acetyl-shikonin and beta-hydroxyisovaleryl-shikonin, the two most abundant derivatives in both Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed "hairy-root" cultures and greenhouse-grown plant roots, were the most biologically active of the seven compounds tested. Hyphae of the pathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, and Nectria hematococca induced localized pigment production upon contact with the roots. Challenge by R. solani crude elicitor increased shikonin derivative production 30-fold. We have studied the regulation of this suite of related, differentially produced, differentially active compounds to understand their role(s) in plant defense at the cellular level in the rhizosphere.</div></div>

Singapore's foray into biotechnology is generally considered an economic and scientific success, its most visible sign being Biopolis, launched in 2003 as an integrated cluster of research facilities in an urban setting. Biopolis, however, is itself the result of a long-term effort to build up capacities for biotechnological research. The present article analyzes the early (pre-Biopolis) biotechnology discourse in Singapore, with special emphasis on its representations in the official media and on its strategic uses by the various stakeholders involved. Against the backdrop of the global emergence of biotechnology from the late 1970s onward, the article traces the motivations for Singapore's formulation of its own biotechnology policy, paying attention throughout to the dynamic between scientists and policy makers. It is this relationship, along with the ambiguities that characterize it, that is responsible for the sustained establishment of biotechnology in Singapore. At an interpretative level, an attempt is made to compare the case of Singapore's biotechnology policy with competing discourses of technology and modernity. The discourse on biotechnology can thus be recognized as a means of mobilizing its intended audience for the various stages in the country's path toward (real or perceived) modernization.</div></div>

8. Pretend to Teach it to a Child as a Storyteller

Once upon a time, there were two people named Lily and Jack. Lily was a very busy woman who worked very hard at her job. She loved her job, but she didn't have much time for anything else. Jack, on the other hand, was an artist who loved to paint. He had moved back to his hometown to start fresh, but he was having a hard time making ends meet.

One day, Lily's car broke down, and she didn't know what to do. She was in a hurry to get to an important meeting, but she couldn't drive her car anymore. She saw a sign that said "Cabin Rentals" and decided to check it out. To her surprise, she found Jack's cozy cabin. She knocked on the door, and Jack answered. He invited her inside, and she spent the night at his cabin.

As they spent more time together, Lily and Jack fell in love. They realized that there's more to life than just work and success. They learned to prioritize their relationships with their loved ones and follow their dreams. They also learned to spread joy and kindness during the holiday season.

Lily and Jack's love story is a reminder that love, forgiveness, and family are the most important things in life. We should prioritize our relationships with our loved ones and find a healthy balance between work and personal life. We should also remember to spread joy and kindness during the holiday season and throughout the year.

The End.</div></div>

```

## Understanding Data

```
df.dtypes
df['white_king_rank'].unique(), df['white_rook_rank'].unique()
```

Should we keep the rank variable numeric? Seems more categorical (ie 1, 2, etc are row names, not a true continuous variable like height or weight)

```
df['result'].unique()
df.shape
```

draw is a draw, numbers are # of turns to a win

```
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 8), dpi=80)
sns.countplot(data=df, x='result')
# binary result fits with Santorini (draws aren't possible in that game)
df['win'] = df['result'] != 'draw'
df['win'] = df['win'].astype(int)
df.win.mean() #90%ish are wins
```

## Create series of dummy variables for columns

```
for col in df.columns:
    if "rank" in col:
        df[col] = df[col].astype(str)

df.dtypes
dummy_df = copy.deepcopy(df)
del dummy_df['result']
dummy_df = pd.get_dummies(dummy_df)
dummy_df['result'] = df['result']
dummy_df.head()
```

Quick check: what variables are statisitcally significant?

```
formula_str = 'win ~ '
col_list = []
for col in df.columns:
    if col != 'result' and col != 'win':
        formula_str += col + ' + '
        col_list.append(col)
    
formula_str = formula_str[0:len(formula_str) - 3] # remove last plus sign    
print(formula_str)

probit_model = smf.probit(data = df, formula = formula_str).fit()
probit_model.summary()
```

white king's ocation seem's meaningless, most of everything else is meaningful

Multinomial probit on result variable is also possible, but would have 17 different models, not very readable

# Sklearn - No Parameter Tuning, No Scaling

Won't have time to analyze individual boards in Santorini. Will need to rely on on predictions

## Data Setup

```
col_list = []
for col in dummy_df.columns:
    if col != 'win' and col != 'result':
        col_list.append(col)

X = dummy_df.loc[:, col_list]
y = dummy_df['win']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, stratify=y)
Counter(y_test)
```

Next piece will remain commented out. Don't need to scale binary variables. But good practice to do it anyway

```
# scaler = StandardScaler()
# scaler.fit(X_train)
# X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
# X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

## Model 1: Linear SVM

```
linear_svc = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=0, probability = True)
y_pred_class, y_pred_prob = get_predictions(linear_svc, X_train, y_train, X_test)
analyze_accuracy(y_test, y_pred_prob, y_pred_class)
```

SVM is worse than nothing!

# Model 2: Non-linear SVM

```
kernel_svc = SVC(kernel='rbf', gamma = 'auto', random_state=0, probability = True)
y_pred_class_rbf, y_pred_prob_rbf = get_predictions(kernel_svc, X_train, y_train, X_test)
analyze_accuracy(y_test, y_pred_prob_rbf, y_pred_class_rbf)
```

What happened to the ROC curve? Separate note: model is still useless

```
sns.distplot(y_pred_prob_rbf)
sns.distplot(y_pred_prob)
```

Kernel RBF predicts some low values. Linear RBF predicts ONLY high ones

## Model 3: Decision Trees - Bagging

```
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

y_pred_class_rf, y_pred_prob_rf = get_predictions(rf_model, X_train, y_train, X_test)
analyze_accuracy(y_test, y_pred_prob_rf, y_pred_class_rf)
```

Hey! Some correctly predicted 0s now!

## Model 4 - Decision Trees (Boosting)

```
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
xgb = XGBClassifier(booster='gbtree', random_state=0)
y_pred_class_xg, y_pred_prob_xg = get_predictions(xgb, X_train, y_train, X_test)
analyze_accuracy(y_test, y_pred_prob_xg, y_pred_class_xg)
```

Only 11 misses! Best model thus far. But I also want to look into parameter tuning

# Grid Search

Going to only look at kernel SVM since grid search takes very long

```
params = {'C': [10 ** n for n in range(-1,3)],
        'gamma' : [10 ** n for n in range(-2,1)],
        'kernel' : ['rbf']}
params
grid_search_svc = GridSearchCV(estimator =SVC(random_state=0, probability = True),
                        param_grid = params,
                        cv = 4,
                        scoring = 'neg_log_loss',
                        n_jobs = -1,
                        verbose = 4)
y_pred_class_cv, y_pred_prob_cv = get_predictions(grid_search_svc, X_train, y_train, X_test)
analyze_accuracy(y_test, y_pred_prob_cv, y_pred_class_cv)
```

Only 5 errors! But it took an hour and half to run

## Calibration

## Pre-Calibration

Classification is binary (in this case), did it pick the right group?
But we also might be interested in probability. What is the chance of a winning with this move?

Calibration means those percentages are accurate. For example, a move that gives a 70% chance of victory
should win about 70% of the time. If a win that shows a 70% chance of victory wins 99% of the time or 51% of
time, it would be an accurate prediction, but poorly calibrated

```
from sklearn.calibration import calibration_curve

plot_calibration(y_test, y_pred_prob_cv)
```

Doesn't look terribly well calibrated. Let's compare to some other models

```
# Random Forest:
plot_calibration(y_test, y_pred_prob_rf)

#XG Boost
plot_calibration(y_test, y_pred_prob_xg)
```

XG Boost looks the best calibrated. But none are particularly great.

Two types of scaling
* Platt's scaling (i.e. sigmoid). Fits a logistic regression to predictions
* Monotonic regression (i.e. isotonic). Fits it to a piecewise constantly increasing model

```
rf_platt = CalibratedClassifierCV(rf_model, method = 'sigmoid')
rf_iso = CalibratedClassifierCV(rf_model, method = 'isotonic')
_ , pred_prob_platt = get_predictions(rf_platt, X_train, y_train, X_test)
_ , pred_prob_iso = get_predictions(rf_iso, X_train, y_train, X_test)
print("Original")
plot_calibration(y_test, y_pred_prob_rf)
print("Platt Calibration")
plot_calibration(y_test, pred_prob_platt)
print("Isotonic Calibration")
plot_calibration(y_test, pred_prob_iso)
```

Some noticeable change in calibrations

## Scaling - XG Boost

```
xg_platt = CalibratedClassifierCV(xgb, method = 'sigmoid')
xg_iso = CalibratedClassifierCV(xgb, method = 'isotonic')
_ , xg_prob_platt = get_predictions(xg_platt, X_train, y_train, X_test)
_ , xg_prob_iso = get_predictions(xg_iso, X_train, y_train, X_test)
print("Original")
plot_calibration(y_test, y_pred_prob_xg)
print("Platt Calibration")
plot_calibration(y_test, xg_prob_platt)
print("Isotonic Calibration")
plot_calibration(y_test, xg_prob_iso)
```

Not really clear if that made it better

# Extentions

The techniques aboves are probably sufficient for this dataset.
However, I don't care about predicting chess moves, I want this to inform the Santorini AI.
As such, I will try three more pieces that help the Santorini project, but aren't needed here:

* Bayesian Optimization (an improvement on grid search)
* Auto ML (not used in AI as far as I know, but worth using)
* Deep Neural Networks (the models actually used by game AI's like AlphaZero)

Note: The NN will be in a different file, since it requries separate usage in Anaconda

## Bayesian Optimization

```
opt = BayesSearchCV(
        estimator =XGBClassifier(booster='gbtree', random_state=0),
        search_spaces = {
            'max_depth': Integer(3, 10),
            'gamma': Real(1e-6, 1e+1, prior='log-uniform'),
            'colsample_bytree': Real(0.5, 0.9, prior='uniform')},
        n_iter = 16,
        random_state = 0,
        cv = 3,
        n_jobs = -1,
        verbose = 4,
)
xg_opt_calib = CalibratedClassifierCV(opt, method = 'isotonic')

_ , bayes_opt_pred = get_predictions(xg_opt_calib, X_train, y_train, X_test)
print("Original")
plot_calibration(y_test, y_pred_prob_xg)
print("Isotonic Calibration")
plot_calibration(y_test, bayes_opt_pred)
```

A bit awkward in the 70-80% range. Better elsewhere

```
# Side note: what were the best version of these hyperparmaters?
opt = BayesSearchCV(
        estimator =XGBClassifier(booster='gbtree', random_state=0),
        search_spaces = {
            'max_depth': Integer(3, 10),
            'gamma': Real(1e-6, 1e+1, prior='log-uniform'),
            'colsample_bytree': Real(0.5, 0.9, prior='uniform')},
        n_iter = 16,
        random_state = 0,
        cv = 3,
        n_jobs = -1,
        verbose = 0,
)

opt.fit(X_train, y_train)
opt.best_estimator_
```

# AutoML

The least interpretable model, but worth trying

```
column_descriptions = {
    'win': 'output',
}

ml_predictor = Predictor(type_of_estimator='classifier', column_descriptions=column_descriptions)

X_train['win'] = y_train.values

ml_predictor.train(X_train)
ml_predictor.score(X_test, y_test)
```

This work was conducted at a large gold mine in Paracatu, MG, Brazil, between March 2000 and November 2005. The waste rock studied was a phyllite which contained (in addition to gold) sulfides such as pyrite and arsenopyrite. The objective was to evaluate the survival and growth of plant species on different combinations of plant growth substrate layers deposited over the spoil. Each combination tested consisted of a cover-layer and a final sealing-layer, both deposited over the remaining, slightly-weathered rock spoils. The treatments were as follows: (T1) a cover layer with 50 cm of partially weathered spoil (B1) with lime added over a compacted sealing layer with 30 cm of B1; (T2) a cover layer with 25 cm of limed native soil over 25 cm of limed B1 over a compacted sealing layer of 30 cm of B1; (T3) a cover layer with 50 cm of limed B1 over a compacted sealing layer of 20 cm of limed soil over 20 cm of unlimed B1; and (T4) a cover layer with 25 cm of limed soil over 25 cm of limed B1 over 20 cm of compacted limed soil over 20 cm of unlimed B1. The plant species used were Acacia farnesiana, A. holosericea, A. polyphylla, Albizia lebbeck, Clitoria fairchildiana, Flemingia sp., Mimosa artemisiana, M. bimucronata, and Enterolobium timbauva. Experimental data included diameter of the stem collar (DC), plant height, and survival counts. The greatest survival rate was observed with T4, at 80%. In general, M. bimucronata and A. farnesiana species showed the highest survival rate. The Scott-Knott test a p &lt; 5% indicated that A. holosericea had the greatest growth-response, while A. polyphylla, Flemingia sp., and E. timbauva exhibited lower growth rates. The bioavailable soil As content from (T1), (T2), (T3), and (T4) was 14.69, 0.00, 10.41, and 0.00 mg dm -3 , respectively. These experimental results support the conclusion that presence of native soil is essential for establishment of plants and minimization of plant toxins like As in mine reclamation efforts, and that appropriate implementation of layer combinations such as studied here allows greater survival rates and biomass gains.</div></div>

8. Pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller

Once upon a time, there was a man named Anthony who wanted to help people start their own businesses. He wrote a book called Nolo's Quick LLC to teach them how to form a special type of business called an LLC.

An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is like a superhero suit for your business. It helps protect you from bad guys like lawsuits and taxes. But, just like a superhero, you have to follow certain rules to wear the suit properly.

In his book, Anthony tells the story of a brave entrepreneur named Jane who wants to start her own business. She decides to form an LLC to protect herself and her business. First, she has to choose the right type of superhero suit for her business. There are many types of suits, but Jane decides that an LLC is the best one for her.

Next, Jane has to create a special document called articles of organization. This document is like a blueprint for her superhero suit. She has to fill it out with information about her business, like its name and address. Then, she has to send it to a special group of people called the secretary of state.

After that, Jane has to get a special number called an EIN. This number is like a secret code that allows her business to talk to the government. She has to apply for this number online or by mail.

Next, Jane needs to create a written agreement called an operating agreement. This agreement is like a set of rules for her superhero suit. It tells everyone who is part of her business what their jobs are and how they should work together.

Finally, Jane has to follow some rules to keep her superhero suit in good shape. She has to tell the government how much money her business made each year, and she has to pay taxes on that money. She also has to keep her business information up-to-date, so that people can find her if they need to.

With the help of Anthony's book, Jane is able to start her own business and protect herself from the bad guys. And she lives happily ever after, knowing that her business is safe and secure.

And that's the end of the story. But remember, kids, if you want to start your own business, you can use Anthony's book to help you too. Just follow the steps he outlines, and you'll be on your way to becoming a successful entrepreneur!</div></div>

Despite advances in immunosupressive therapy rejection remains the most common complication of liver transplantation in both the early and the late post-transplant period. Unlike other solid organs, liver graft rejection has some specific characteristics likely attributable to the unique immunobiologic properties and the remarkable regenerative capabilities of liver parenchyma. Acute cellular rejection is the most frequent type of the rejection episode in the liver allograft, whereas chronic (ductopenic) rejection and humoral rejection are uncommon. Since the clinical findings are not entirely characteristic, histopathological evaluation of liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of rejection. However, the close cooperation between the pathologist and the clinician is essential for the correct interpretation of morphologic changes.</div></div>

This paper presented a dynamic road network traffic flow simulation model. This model first uses gravity-based O-D estimation method to calculate the travel demand matrix of different sub regions. Second, this paper constructs a road network model on the basis of complex network and link resistance model to connect different traffic sub-zones. In addition, on the assumption that reasonable people usually choose the shortest path with minimum link resistance as their travel path, a mapping algorithm from travel demand to volume of traffic flow is introduced in our model. On the basis of the discrete-event simulation method, a simulation prototype system on PC is implemented. Experimental results show that this simulation system can simulate the dynamic evolution of travel demand and traffic flow in real time way and the model is effective.</div></div>

This notebook executes the second step of a data science process, manipulate and transform the raw data sets into an analysis data set for constructing a machine learning model, or for the machine learning model to consume. You must run the `1_data_ingestion` notebook before running this notebook.

The scenario is constructed as a pipeline flow, where each notebook is optimized to perform in a batch setting for each of the ingest, feature engineering, model building, model scoring operations. To accomplish this, this `2a_feature_engineering` notebook is designed to be used to generate a general data set for any of the training, calibrate, test or scoring operations. In this scenario, we use a temporal split strategy for these operations, so the notebook parameters are used to set date range filtering. The notebook creates a labeled data set using the parameters start_date and to_date to select the time period for training. This data set is stored in the features_table specified. After this cell completes, you should see the dataset under the Databricks Data icon.

You can `Run All` cells, or use the Databricks CLI to create a Databricks Job to do the same process automatically.

To examine the SPARK analysis data sets constructed in this notebook, the optional `2a_feature_exploration` notebook has been included in the repostiory and copied to your Azure Databricks Workspace. You must run this `engineering` notebook before running the `exploration` notebook, which details the feature dataset created here for use in this predictive maintenance solution example.

According to [Wikipedia, Feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. 

This Feature engineering notebook will load the data sets created in the **Data Ingestion** notebook (`1_data_ingestion`) from an Azure storage container and combine them to create a single data set of features (variables) that can be used to infer a machines's health condition over time. The notebook steps through several feature engineering and labeling methods to create this data set for use in our predictive maintenance machine learning solution.

**Note:** This notebook will take  less than a minute to execute all cells, depending on the compute configuration you have setup.

## Feature engineering 

Our feature engineering will combine the different data sources together to create a single data set of features (variables) that can be used to infer a machines's health condition over time. The ultimate goal is to generate a single record for each time unit within each asset. The record combines features and labels to be fed into the machine learning algorithm.

Predictive maintenance take historical data, marked with a timestamp, to predict current health of a component and the probability of failure within some future window of time. These problems can be characterised as a _classification method_ involving _time series_ data. Time series, since we want to use historical observations to predict what will happen in the future. Classification, because we classify the future as having a probability of failure.

### Lag features

There are many ways of creating features from the time series data. We start by dividing the duration of data collection into time units where each record belongs to a single point in time for each asset. The measurement unit for is in fact arbitrary. Time can be in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or months, or it can be measured in cycles, miles or transactions. The measurement choice is typically specific to the use case domain.

Additionally, the time unit does not have to be the same as the frequency of data collection. For example, if temperature values were being collected every 10 seconds, picking a time unit of 10 seconds for analysis may inflate the number of examples without providing any additional information if the temperature changes slowly. A better strategy may be to average the temperature over a longer time horizon which might better capture variations that contribute to the target outcome.

Once we set the frequency of observations, we want to look for trends within measures, over time, in order to predict performance degradation, which we would like to connect to how likely a component will fail. We create features for these trends within each record using time lags over previous observations to check for these performance changes. The lag window size $W$ is a hyper parameter that we can optimize. The following figures indicate a _rolling aggregate window_ strategy for averaging a measure $t_i$ over a window $W = 3$ previous observations. We are not constrained to averages, we can roll aggregates over counts, average, the standard deviation, outliers based on standard deviations, CUSUM measures, minimum and maximum values for the window. 

![Rolling Aggregates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance/master/images/rolling-aggregate-features.png)

We could also use a tumbling window approach, if we were interested in a different time window measure than the frequncy of the observations. For example, we might have obersvations evert 6 or 12 hours, but want to create features aligned on a day or week basis.  


![Tumbling Aggregates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance/master/images/tumbling-aggregate-features.png)

In the following sections, we will build our features using only a rolling strategy to demonstrate the process. We align our data, and then build features along those normalized observations times. We start with the telemetry data.

## Telemetry features

Because the telemetry data set is the largest time series data we have, we start feature engineering here. The telemetry data has 8761000 hourly observations for out 1000 machines. We can improve the model performance by aligning our data by aggregating average sensor measures on a tumbling 12 hour window. In this case we replace the raw data with the tumbling window data, reducing the sensor data to 731000 observations. This will directly reduce the computaton time required to do the feature engineering, labeling and modeling required for our solution.    

Once we have the reduced data, we set up our lag features by compute rolling aggregate measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc. to represent the short term history of the telemetry over time. 

The following code blocks alignes the data on 12 hour observations and calculates a rolling mean and standard deviation of the telemetry data over the last 12, 24 and 36 hour lags.

```
TO_DATE = dbutils.widgets.get("to_date")
START_DATE = dbutils.widgets.get("start_date")
telemetry = spark.table(TELEMETRY_DATA).where(F.col("datetime") &lt;= TO_DATE).where(F.col("datetime") > START_DATE).cache()

# rolling mean and standard deviation
# Temporary storage for rolling means
tel_mean = telemetry

# Which features are we interested in telemetry data set
rolling_features = ['volt','rotate', 'pressure', 'vibration']
      
# n hours = n * 3600 seconds  
time_val = 12 * 3600

# Choose the time_val hour timestamps to align the data
# dt_truncated looks at the column named "datetime" in the current data set.
# remember that Spark is lazy... this doesn't execute until it is in a withColumn statement.
dt_truncated = ((round(unix_timestamp(col("datetime")) / time_val) * time_val).cast("timestamp"))
# We choose windows for our rolling windows 12hrs, 24 hrs and 36 hrs
lags = [12, 24, 36]

# align the data
for lag_n in lags:
    wSpec = Window.partitionBy('machineID').orderBy('datetime').rowsBetween(1-lag_n, 0)
    for col_name in rolling_features:
        tel_mean = tel_mean.withColumn(col_name+'_rollingmean_'+str(lag_n), 
                                       F.avg(col(col_name)).over(wSpec))
        tel_mean = tel_mean.withColumn(col_name+'_rollingstd_'+str(lag_n), 
                                       F.stddev(col(col_name)).over(wSpec))

# Calculate lag values...
telemetry_feat = (tel_mean.withColumn("dt_truncated", dt_truncated)
                  .drop('volt', 'rotate', 'pressure', 'vibration')
                  .fillna(0)
                  .groupBy("machineID","dt_truncated")

                       F.mean('vibration_rollingmean_12').alias('vibration_rollingmean_12'), 
                       F.mean('volt_rollingmean_24').alias('volt_rollingmean_24'),
                       F.mean('rotate_rollingmean_24').alias('rotate_rollingmean_24'), 
                       F.mean('pressure_rollingmean_24').alias('pressure_rollingmean_24'), 
                       F.mean('vibration_rollingmean_24').alias('vibration_rollingmean_24'),
                       F.mean('volt_rollingmean_36').alias('volt_rollingmean_36'),
                       F.mean('vibration_rollingmean_36').alias('vibration_rollingmean_36'),
                       F.mean('rotate_rollingmean_36').alias('rotate_rollingmean_36'),

                       F.stddev('vibration_rollingstd_36').alias('vibration_rollingstd_36'), )).cache()
```

## Errors features

Like telemetry data, errors come with timestamps. An important difference is that the error IDs are categorical values and should not be averaged over time intervals like the telemetry measurements. Instead, we count the number of errors of each type within a lag window. 

Again, we align the error counts data by tumbling over the 12 hour window using a join with telemetry data.

```
errors = spark.table(ERROR_DATA).where(F.col("datetime") &lt;= TO_DATE).where(F.col("datetime") > START_DATE).cache()

# create a column for each errorID 
error_ind = (errors.groupBy("machineID","datetime","errorID").pivot('errorID')
             .agg(F.count('machineID').alias('dummy')).drop('errorID').fillna(0)
             .groupBy("machineID","datetime")
             .agg(F.sum('error1').alias('error1sum'), 
                  F.sum('error2').alias('error2sum'), 
                  F.sum('error3').alias('error3sum'), 
                  F.sum('error4').alias('error4sum'), 
                  F.sum('error5').alias('error5sum')))

# join the telemetry data with errors
error_count = (telemetry.join(error_ind, 
                              ((telemetry['machineID'] == error_ind['machineID']) 
                               &amp; (telemetry['datetime'] == error_ind['datetime'])), "left")
               .drop('volt', 'rotate', 'pressure', 'vibration')
               .drop(error_ind.machineID).drop(error_ind.datetime)
               .fillna(0))

error_features = ['error1sum','error2sum', 'error3sum', 'error4sum', 'error5sum']

wSpec = Window.partitionBy('machineID').orderBy('datetime').rowsBetween(1-24, 0)
for col_name in error_features:
    # We're only interested in the erros in the previous 24 hours.
    error_count = error_count.withColumn(col_name+'_rollingmean_24', 
                                         F.avg(col(col_name)).over(wSpec))

error_feat = (error_count.withColumn("dt_truncated", dt_truncated)
              .drop('error1sum', 'error2sum', 'error3sum', 'error4sum', 'error5sum').fillna(0)
              .groupBy("machineID","dt_truncated")
              .agg(F.mean('error1sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error1sum_rollingmean_24'), 
                   F.mean('error2sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error2sum_rollingmean_24'), 
                   F.mean('error3sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error3sum_rollingmean_24'), 
                   F.mean('error4sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error4sum_rollingmean_24'), 
                   F.mean('error5sum_rollingmean_24').alias('error5sum_rollingmean_24')))
```

## Days since last replacement from maintenance 

A crucial data set in this example is the use of maintenance records, which contain the information regarding component replacement. Possible features from this data set can be the number of replacements of each component over time or to calculate how long it has been since a component has been replaced. Replacement time is expected to correlate better with component failures since the longer a component is used, the more degradation would be expected.

As a side note, creating lagging features from maintenance data is not straight forward. This type of ad-hoc feature engineering is very common in predictive maintenance as domain knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the predictors of a failure problem. In the following code blocks, the days since last component replacement are calculated for each component from the maintenance data. We start by counting the component replacements for the set of machines.

```
maint = spark.table(MAINT_DATA).where(F.col("datetime") &lt;= TO_DATE).where(F.col("datetime") > START_DATE).cache()

# create a column for each component replacement
maint_replace = (maint.groupBy("machineID","datetime","comp").pivot('comp')
                 .agg(F.count('machineID').alias('dummy')).fillna(0)
                 .groupBy("machineID","datetime")
                 .agg(F.sum('comp1').alias('comp1sum'), 
                      F.sum('comp2').alias('comp2sum'), 
                      F.sum('comp3').alias('comp3sum'),
                      F.sum('comp4').alias('comp4sum'))
                 .withColumnRenamed('datetime','datetime_maint')).cache()
```

Replacement features are then created by tracking the number of days between each component replacement. We'll repeat these calculations for each of the four components and join them together into a maintenance feature table.

First component number 1 (`comp1`):

```
# We want to align the component information on telemetry features timestamps.
telemetry_times = (telemetry_feat.select(telemetry_feat.machineID, telemetry_feat.dt_truncated)
                   .withColumnRenamed('dt_truncated','datetime_tel')).cache()
def grab_component_records(self, telemetry_times, comp_sum="comp1sum", sincelastcomp_="sincelastcomp1",
                          comp_a='comp2sum', comp_b='comp3sum', comp_c='comp4sum'):
    maint_comp = (self.where(col(comp_sum) == '1').withColumnRenamed('datetime', 'datetime_maint')
                  .drop(comp_a, comp_b, comp_c)).cache()
    # Within each machine, get the last replacement date for each timepoint
    maint_tel_comp = (telemetry_times.join(maint_comp,
                                           ((telemetry_times['machineID'] == maint_comp['machineID'])
                                            &amp; (telemetry_times['datetime_tel'] > maint_comp['datetime_maint'])
                                            &amp; (maint_comp[(comp_sum)] == '1')))
                      .drop(maint_comp.machineID)).cache()
    # Calculate the number of days between replacements
    return (maint_tel_comp.withColumn(sincelastcomp_,
                                      datediff(maint_tel_comp.datetime_tel, maint_tel_comp.datetime_maint))
            .drop(maint_tel_comp.datetime_maint).drop(maint_tel_comp[comp_sum])).cache()

## Machine features

The machine features capture specifics of the individuals. These can be used without further modification since it include descriptive information about the type of each machine and its age (number of years in service). If the age information had been recorded as a "first use date" for each machine, a transformation would have been necessary to turn those into a numeric values indicating the years in service.

We do need to create a set of dummy features, a set of boolean variables, to indicate the model of the machine. This can either be done manually, or using a _one-hot encoding_ step. We use the one-hot encoding for demonstration purposes.

```
machines = spark.table(MACH_DATA).cache()

# one hot encoding of the variable model, basically creates a set of dummy boolean variables
catVarNames = ['model']  
sIndexers = [StringIndexer(inputCol=x, outputCol=x + '_indexed') for x in catVarNames]
machines_cat = Pipeline(stages=sIndexers).fit(machines).transform(machines)

# one-hot encode
ohEncoders = [OneHotEncoder(inputCol=x + '_indexed', outputCol=x + '_encoded')
              for x in catVarNames]

ohPipelineModel = Pipeline(stages=ohEncoders).fit(machines_cat)
machines_cat = ohPipelineModel.transform(machines_cat)

drop_list = [col_n for col_n in machines_cat.columns if 'indexed' in col_n]

machines_feat = machines_cat.select([column for column in machines_cat.columns if column not in drop_list]).cache()
```

## Merging feature data

Next, we merge the telemetry, maintenance, machine and error feature data sets into a large feature data set. Since most of the data has already been aligned on the 12 hour observation period, we can merge with a simple join strategy.

```
# join error features with component maintenance features
error_maint = (error_feat.join(maint_feat, 
                               ((error_feat['machineID'] == maint_feat['machineID']) 
                                &amp; (error_feat['dt_truncated'] == maint_feat['dt_truncated'])), "left")
               .drop(maint_feat.machineID).drop(maint_feat.dt_truncated))

# now join that with machines features
error_maint_feat = (error_maint.join(machines_feat, 
                                     ((error_maint['machineID'] == machines_feat['machineID'])), "left")
                    .drop(machines_feat.machineID))

# Clean up some unecessary columns
error_maint_feat = error_maint_feat.select([c for c in error_maint_feat.columns if c not in 
                                            {'error1sum', 'error2sum', 'error3sum', 'error4sum', 'error5sum'}])

# join telemetry with error/maint/machine features to create final feature matrix
final_feat = (telemetry_feat.join(error_maint_feat, 
                                  ((telemetry_feat['machineID'] == error_maint_feat['machineID']) 
                                   &amp; (telemetry_feat['dt_truncated'] == error_maint_feat['dt_truncated'])), "left")
              .drop(error_maint_feat.machineID).drop(error_maint_feat.dt_truncated))
```

# Label construction

Predictive maintenance is supervised learning. To train a model to predict failures requires examples of failures, and the time series of observations leading up to those failures. Additionally, the model needs examples of periods of healthy operation in order to discern the difference between the two states. The classification between these states is typically a boolean label (healthy vs failed).

Once we have the healthy vs. failure states, the predictive maintenance approach is only useful if the method will give some advanced warning of an impending failure. To accomplish this _prior warning_ criteria, we slightly modify the label definition from a _failure event_ which occurs at a specific moment in time, to a longer window of _failure event occurs within this window_. The window length is defined by the business criteria. Is knowing a failure will occur within 12 hours, enough time to prevent the failure from happening? Is 24 hours, or 2 weeks? The ability of the model to accurately predict an impending failure is dependent sizing this window. If the failure signal is short, longer windows will not help, and can actually degrade, the potential performance.   

To acheive the redefinition of failure to _about to fail_, we over label failure events, labeling all observations within the failure warning window as failed. The prediction problem then becomes estimating the probability of failure within this window. For this example scenerio, we estimate the probability that a machine will fail in the near future due to a failure of a certain component. More specifically, the goal is to compute the probability that a machine will fail in the next 7 days due to a component failure (component 1, 2, 3, or 4). 

![Data Labeling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/BatchSparkScoringPredictiveMaintenance/master/images/labelling-for-binary-classification.png)

Below, a categorical failure feature is created to serve as the label. All records within a 24 hour window before a failure of component 1 have failure="comp1", and so on for components 2, 3, and 4; all records not within 7 days of a component failure have failure="none".

The first step is to align the failure data to the feature observation time points (every 12 hours).

```
failures = spark.table(FAILURE_DATA).where(F.col("datetime") &lt;= TO_DATE).where(F.col("datetime") > START_DATE) .cache()

# We need to redefine dt_truncated to align with the failures table
dt_truncated = ((round(unix_timestamp(col("datetime")) / time_val) * time_val).cast("timestamp"))

fail_diff = (failures.withColumn("dt_truncated", dt_truncated)
             .drop(failures.datetime))
```

Next, we convert the labels from text to numeric values. In the end, this will transform the problem from boolean of 'healthy'/'impending failure' to a multiclass 'healthy'/'component `n` impending failure'.

```
# map the failure data to final feature matrix
labeled_features = (final_feat.join(fail_diff, 
                                    ((final_feat['machineID'] == fail_diff['machineID']) 
                                     &amp; (final_feat['dt_truncated'] == fail_diff['dt_truncated'])), "left")
                    .drop(fail_diff.machineID).drop(fail_diff.dt_truncated)
                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == "comp1", 1.0).otherwise(col('failure')))
                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == "comp2", 2.0).otherwise(col('failure')))
                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == "comp3", 3.0).otherwise(col('failure')))
                    .withColumn('failure', F.when(col('failure') == "comp4", 4.0).otherwise(col('failure'))))

labeled_features = (labeled_features.withColumn("failure", 
                                                labeled_features.failure.cast(DoubleType()))
                    .fillna(0))
```

To now, we have labels as _failure events_. To convert to _impending failure_, we over label over the previous 7 days as _failed_.

```
# lag values to manually backfill label (bfill =7)
my_window = Window.partitionBy('machineID').orderBy(labeled_features.dt_truncated.desc())

# Create the previous 7 days 
labeled_features = (labeled_features.withColumn("prev_value1",

                                                F.lag(labeled_features.prev_value6).
                                                over(my_window)).fillna(0))

# Create a label features
labeled_features = (labeled_features.withColumn('label', labeled_features.failure + 
                                                labeled_features.prev_value1 +

                                                labeled_features.prev_value7))

# Restrict the label to be on the range of 0:4, and remove extra columns
labeled_features = (labeled_features.withColumn('label_e', F.when(col('label') > 4, 4.0)

labeled_features.write.mode('overwrite').saveAsTable(dbutils.widgets.get("features_table"))
```

## Conclusion

We have now stored the features in an analysis data set required for this Predictive Maintenance scenario as Spark data frames in the Azure Databricks instance. You can examine them in the Data panel accessible on the left. The `./notebooks/2a_feature_exploration` notebook does a preliminary data exploration on this data set to help understand what we are working on. 

The next step is to build and compare machine learning models using the feature data set we have just created. The `./notebooks/2b_model_building` notebook works through building either a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier using this data set.

Lesson: How to Contribute to OpenStreetMap

Introduction:
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project that relies on contributions from people like you to create and maintain a free map of the world. In this lesson, we will learn how to contribute to OSM by adding new data, editing existing data, and sharing our knowledge with others.

Section 1: Adding New Data

Theoretical Concepts:
- Nodes: points on the map
- Ways: lines on the map
- Relations: areas on the map

Practical Examples:
1. Add a new restaurant to the map by creating a node for its location and adding tags to describe it (e.g., "name=Restaurant XYZ").
2. Draw a new bike path by creating a way that connects multiple nodes and adding tags to describe the path (e.g., "bicycle=yes").
3. Create a new park by drawing a polygon around it using a relation and adding tags to describe the park (e.g., "leisure=park").

Section 2: Editing Existing Data

Theoretical Concepts:
- Changeset: a collection of edits made to the map
- Revision: a historical version of the map

Practical Examples:
1. Correct a misspelled street name by editing the node and way tags.
2. Close a gap in a road by connecting two adjacent ways.
3. Remove a duplicate node from a major route by deleting it and merging the ways.

Section 3: Sharing Knowledge

Theoretical Concepts:
- Talk: a discussion forum for mapping questions and ideas
- Wiki: a collection of documentation and guides for mapping tools and techniques

Practical Examples:
1. Ask a question about mapping techniques or software on the talk forum.
2. Contribute to the wiki by writing guides or updating existing documentation.
3. Organize a local mapping party to bring together members of the community and improve the map in your area.

Conclusion:
By contributing to OpenStreetMap, you are helping to create a free and open map of the world that can be used by anyone. Whether you are adding new data, editing existing data, or sharing your knowledge with others, your contributions make a difference. Apply the skills you have learned in this lesson to new problems and continue to improve the map for everyone.

The exiting PSO algorithms are analyzed deeply, a multi-swarm PSO (MSPSO) is studied. The whole swarm is divided into three sub-swarms randomly, the first particle group obeys the standard PSO principle to search the optimal result, the second searches randomly inner neighborhood of the optimal result, the third does not care about the optimal result but flies freely according to themselves velocities and positions. So the algorithm enhances its global searching space, enriches particlespsila diversity in order to let particles jump out local optimization points. Testing and comparing results with standard PSO and linearly decreasing weight PSO by several widely used benchmark functions show optimization performance of the algorithm is better. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is employed to resolve the operational optimization problems of ethylene cracking furnace. The operational optimization results for built cracking model are effective and satisfying.</div></div>

Vacuum breakdown is a very common problem during the operation of any electron gun. Arcing occurs due to high voltage break down of cathode - anode gap. This not only spoils the job, it also causes lot of damage to the electronic component of the system and damage to the emitter. In this work, a detailed study of the cause of the high voltage breakdown in the gun in the electron beam evaporation system, analysis of the electrical parameters of arc discharge inside the electron gun due to high voltage break down and suitable solution to the arc discharge problem has been presented. Power supplies need to be protected against surges arising out of high voltage breakdown. Ferrite beads have been used to suppress the high frequency content of the breakdown signal. High frequency content of the signal in the MHz range can be attenuated to lower range of KHz by use of ferrite bead thereby protecting against high frequency surges. On the other hand during breakdown there is a sudden increase in the current which needs to be limited without interruption in the process. Possible use of superconductor as fault current limiter has been analyzed in this work.</div></div>

Author: L.M. Brown

Description:
Shifting Currents is a captivating novel that explores the complexities of human relationships and the impact of personal choices on one's destiny. The story follows the journey of two sisters, Lily and Rose, as they navigate through the ups and downs of life. Lily, the elder sister, is a successful businesswoman who seems to have it all, but her seemingly perfect life is shattered when she discovers a shocking secret about her husband. On the other hand, Rose, the younger sister, has always lived in the shadows of her sister's success, but she finds solace in her art. However, her passion for painting leads her down a dangerous path that threatens to destroy her family. As the sisters grapple with their respective challenges, they must learn to trust each other and lean on their faith to overcome the obstacles in their way.

1. Basics (Genre, Premise, Key Takeaways)
Shifting Currents falls under the genre of contemporary fiction. The premise of the book revolves around the theme of sisterhood, betrayal, and redemption. The key takeaways from the book include the importance of trust, forgiveness, and the power of faith. The author skillfully weaves these themes into the narrative, making them relevant and relatable to the reader.

2. Characters or Key Figures
Lily and Rose are the two main characters in the book. Lily is portrayed as a strong and independent woman who appears to have it all. However, her seemingly perfect life is shattered when she discovers that her husband, James, has been leading a double life. This revelation forces Lily to confront her own insecurities and weaknesses, and she must learn to trust herself and others. Rose, on the other hand, is the artistic and sensitive sister who struggles with her own demons. Her passion for painting leads her down a dangerous path, and she must learn to balance her art with her responsibilities to her family.

3. Major Themes (Ideas, Arguments, Approaches, Solutions)
One of the major themes of the book is the importance of trust. Lily's discovery of James' infidelity forces her to question her own trust in him and in herself. She must learn to trust herself and others, even in the face of adversity. This theme is also reflected in Rose's relationship with her husband, who becomes increasingly distant as her art takes over her life. Rose must learn to trust her husband and herself, and she must find a way to balance her art with her responsibilities to her family.

Another major theme of the book is forgiveness. Lily must learn to forgive James for his betrayal, and she must learn to forgive herself for her own mistakes. Rose must learn to forgive herself for her own shortcomings and for the pain she has caused her family. Forgiveness is a powerful force that can heal wounds and restore relationships, and the author explores this theme in depth throughout the book.

The power of faith is another major theme of the book. Lily and Rose both turn to their faith during times of crisis, and they find strength and comfort in their beliefs. Faith provides them with a sense of hope and purpose, and it helps them to overcome the obstacles in their way. The author explores the role of faith in a modern world, and she shows how it can provide comfort and guidance in times of need.

4. Top 5 helpful advices from the book
1. Learn to trust yourself and others. Trust is a powerful force that can heal wounds and restore relationships.
2. Forgiveness is a powerful force that can heal wounds and restore relationships. Learn to forgive yourself and others.
3. Faith provides us with a sense of hope and purpose. Turn to your faith during times of crisis.
4. Balance your passions with your responsibilities. Don't let your passions consume you.
5. Communication is key. Learn to communicate openly and honestly with your loved ones.

5. Reflection
As I reflect on the book, I am struck by the power of sisterhood. Lily and Rose's relationship is complex and multifaceted, but it is ultimately a bond that cannot be broken. Their sisterhood provides them with strength and support during times of crisis, and it helps them to overcome the obstacles in their way. The author explores the role of sisterhood in a modern world, and she shows how it can provide comfort and guidance in times of need.

6. Skill Reproduce
To implement the skill of forgiveness, follow these steps:
1. Acknowledge the hurt. Recognize the pain that has been caused and the harm that has been done.
2. Take responsibility. Accept your role in the situation and take ownership of your actions.
3. Express remorse. Apologize sincerely and show genuine remorse for your actions.
4. Make amends. Make things right by taking action to repair the damage that has been done.
5. Move forward. Let go of the past and focus on the future. Forgiveness is a process, not a destination, and it requires ongoing effort and commitment.

7. Reasoning (Q&amp;A or Interview)
Interviewer: Lily, you seem to have it all - a successful career, a loving husband, and a happy family. But your life is turned upside down when you discover James' infidelity. How did you cope with this betrayal?
Lily: It was a difficult time for me. I felt betrayed and hurt, and I struggled to come to terms with what had happened. But I realized that I couldn't let James' actions define our relationship. I had to learn to trust myself and others, and I had to find a way to move forward.
Interviewer: How did you learn to trust again?
Lily: It wasn't easy, but I started by focusing on my own strengths and weaknesses. I realized that I couldn't control James' actions, but I could control my own. I also sought the support of my friends and family, and I leaned on my faith to provide me with strength and guidance.
Interviewer: Rose, your passion for painting leads you down a dangerous path. How did you cope with the pressure to succeed?
Rose: It was a difficult time for me. I felt overwhelmed by the expectations of others, and I struggled to find a way to balance my art with my responsibilities to my family. But I realized that I couldn't let my passion consume me. I had to learn to balance my art with my responsibilities, and I had to find a way to communicate openly and honestly with my loved ones.
Interviewer: How did you learn to communicate openly and honestly with your loved ones?
Rose: It wasn't easy, but I started by acknowledging the hurt that I had caused. I apologized sincerely and showed genuine remorse for my actions. I also made amends by taking action to repair the damage that had been done. And I committed myself to ongoing effort and commitment to our relationships.

8. Pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller
Once upon a time, there were two sisters named Lily and Rose. Lily was older and very successful, while Rose was younger and more artistic. They both loved each other very much, but they faced many challenges along the way. One day, Lily discovered that her husband, James, had been leading a double life. She was very hurt and didn't know what to do. But she realized that she couldn't let James' actions define their relationship. She learned to trust herself and others, and she found a way to move forward. Rose, on the other hand, struggled with her own demons. Her passion for painting led her down a dangerous path, and she found herself in trouble. But she realized that she couldn't let her passion consume her.

Behavioral modelling of blocks is an important step in wireless system verification. In this paper, we describe the application of an automated technique for macromodel extraction. Called TVP, the technique works directly from detailed transistor-level descriptions (e.g., SPICE) of a block to produce system-level macromodels (e.g., suitable for MATLAB). A key property of TVP is that it can reduce blocks with switching, sampling or frequency-translation properties. MP is efficient for large circuits and can automatically tailor the size of the macromodel to meet a specified accuracy. TVP also produces dominant poles and zeros without need for lengthy simulations. We present applications to RF mixers and switched-capacitor filters, to obtain size reductions of more than two orders of magnitude with no appreciable loss of accuracy.</div></div>

Introduction:
Myocardial bridges are a common anatomical variation in which a segment of the myocardium extends into the epicardial coronary artery. This bridge can compress the artery during systole, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially causing ischemia. In this lesson, we will explore the anatomy, physiology, and clinical significance of myocardial bridges.

Anatomy:
Myocardial bridges are formed when a portion of the myocardial wall is connected to the outer surface of the coronary artery. This connection can occur at any point along the artery, but is most commonly found in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The bridge can vary in length and width, and may be composed of smooth muscle, connective tissue, or both.

Physiology:
During systole, the heart contracts and the myocardial bridge compresses the epicardial coronary artery. This compression can reduce blood flow to the myocardium supplied by that artery, leading to ischemia. The degree of compression and the resulting reduction in blood flow can vary depending on the characteristics of the myocardial bridge. Some bridges may cause only mild compression, while others may result in significant reductions in blood flow.

Clinical Significance:
Myocardial bridges are often discovered incidentally during autopsy or imaging studies. In many cases, they do not cause any symptoms or adverse effects on cardiac function. However, in some individuals, myocardial bridges can lead to chest pain, arrhythmias, or even myocardial infarction. The risk of developing symptoms related to a myocardial bridge is generally higher in individuals with other coronary artery abnormalities or risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Diagnosis:
Myocardial bridges can be diagnosed using a variety of imaging techniques, including angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests can help determine the location, size, and characteristics of the myocardial bridge, as well as assess its impact on coronary blood flow.

Treatment:
In most cases, myocardial bridges do not require treatment. However, in individuals with symptoms related to the bridge, treatment may involve medication to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms, or interventional procedures to improve blood flow to the affected myocardium.

Conclusion:
Myocardial bridges are a common anatomical variation that can compress the epicardial coronary artery during systole, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially causing ischemia. While many myocardial bridges do not cause symptoms, they can contribute to chest pain, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction in some individuals. Diagnosis and treatment of myocardial bridges typically involve imaging studies and interventional procedures, depending on the severity of symptoms.</div></div>

Normal vowels are known to have irregularities in the pitch-to-pitch variation which is quite important for speech signals to be perceived as natural human sound. Such pitch-to-pitch variation of vowels is studied in the light of nonlinear dynamics. For the analysis, five normal vowels recorded from three male and two female subjects are exploited, where the vowel signals are shown to have normal levels of the pitch-to-pitch variation. First, by the false nearest-neighbor analysis, nonlinear dynamics of the vowels are shown to be well analyzed by using a relatively low-dimensional reconstructing dimension of 4 &lt; or = d &lt; or = 7. Then, we further studied nonlinear dynamics of the vowels by spike-and-wave surrogate analysis. The results imply that there exists nonlinear dynamical correlation between one pitch-waveform pattern to another in the vowel signals. On the basis of the analysis results, applicability of the nonlinear prediction technique to vowel synthesis is discussed.</div></div>

```

This loads an image and resizes the image to (224, 224):

 img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
The img_to_array() function adds channels: x.shape = (224, 224, 3) for RGB and (224, 224, 1) for gray image

 x = image.img_to_array(img) 
expand_dims() is used to add the number of images: x.shape = (1, 224, 224, 3):

Input is a tensor with shape (number of images) x (image width) x (image height) x (image depth).

x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
preprocess_input subtracts the mean RGB channels of the imagenet dataset. This is because the model you are using has been trained on a different dataset: x.shape is still (1, 224, 224, 3)

x = preprocess_input(x)
If you add x to an array images, at the end of the loop, you need to add images = np.vstack(images) so that you get (n, 224, 224, 3) as the dim of images where n is the number of images processed

Objectives: Addictive behavior affecting human health is on the rise among adolescents. Cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and illegal drug use are common among university students. Hence, the aim of this study was assessment of the attitude toward substance use and its predictors among final year medical students, faculty of medicine, Cairo University. Materials and Methods: In total, 200 students were randomly chosen during their final year of study. Participants were subjected to semistructured questions that assessed demographics and smoking status of the students, attitude toward substance abuse questionnaire, and Sensation-seeking Scale (SSS). Results: Male individuals comprised 61% compared with 39% of female individuals, and the age for both male students and female students ranged from 21 to 31 years old with a mean value of 23.21±1.09. The majority (95%) did not use substances, whereas 5% used substances at least once during their life. About half of the students (52.5%) scored average on the SSS, whereas 28% scored low and 19% were high on the scale. Comparison between both sexes revealed a significant difference in smoking (P&lt;0.001). Both sexes did not differ in the attitude toward substance abuse and the SSS (P=0.37 and 0.20, respectively). Smokers showed significantly higher scores on attitude toward substance abuse (P&lt;0.001) and also the students who had lifetime substance use (P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Smoking and substance use are more important than age and sex as predictors of attitude of medical students toward substance use.</div></div>

OBJECTIVE
To investigate how well short-term progression rates can predict long-term visual field outcomes in patients with glaucoma.


METHODS
We calculated visual field rates of progression using linear regression analysis of the Visual Field Index (VFI) for 100 consecutive patients with glaucoma having 10 or more Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm standard field tests. Final VFI was predicted on the basis of linear extrapolation of the slope defined by the initial 5 field test results. Final VFI also was estimated using linear regression of all qualifying examination results for each patient. Primary outcome measures were the absolute difference and the correlation between predicted and estimated final VFI values.


RESULTS
Patient follow-up averaged 8.2 years and 11 field examinations. Median VFI progression rate was -1.1% per year both for the initial 5 test results and also for the complete series. Seventy percent of patients had a predicted final VFI within +/-10% of the estimated final VFI, and the 2 VFI calculations had a correlation coefficient of 0.84.


CONCLUSION
Linear extrapolation based on 5 initial visual field test results was a reliable predictor of future field loss in most patients. Patients in whom linear regression analysis suggests dangerously rapid rates of visual field progression may be candidates for significant alterations in therapy.</div></div>

ABSTRACT Geospatial and geometric states of traffic signs are indispensable information for traffic facility maintenance. This study applies a low-cost single camera system to locate and identify traffic signs and reflects their on-site conditions for assisting in maintenance. Referring to official regulations, a traffic sign can be identified and classified based on its color and shape attributes. The poses and states of the sign planes can also be evaluated according to their geometric shape ratios and the discrepancy with respect to traffic sign regulations, in which a least-square consistency check is proposed to ensure assessment reliability and accuracy. Validation with day and nighttime image sequences was performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the robustness to illumination changes, color deterioration, and motion blur. Considering the promising results, this study can be deemed as an alternative to promote routine maintenance of traffic facilities.</div></div>

Once upon a time, there was a woman named Sarah. She used to be a really good hacker, but then something bad happened, and she had to leave that life behind. Now, Sarah works for the FBI as a cybersecurity expert. She's really good at her job, but sometimes she still feels guilty about what happened in the past.

One day, Sarah gets a new case. A rich man named Mr. Johnson has been murdered, and Sarah thinks that a company called NeuralTech might have something to do with it. NeuralTech is a really powerful tech company, and Sarah knows that they're up to something sneaky. She starts investigating, and she discovers that NeuralTech is working on a really dangerous project that could hurt a lot of people.

Sarah is determined to stop NeuralTech and bring justice to Mr. Johnson's family. She works really hard, and she even has to use her old hacking skills to get some information. But she's not alone. She has a friend named Kate who helps her out. Kate is a really tough FBI agent, and she's been working with Sarah for a long time. Together, they figure out what NeuralTech is up to and stop them before they can do any more harm.

In the end, Sarah learns that it's okay to forgive herself for what happened in the past. She realizes that she can still make a difference and help people, even if she's not perfect. And Kate learns that Sarah is a really brave and smart woman, and she's proud to call her a friend. The end.</div></div>

The exploitation of nature for decades due to several anthropogenic activities has changed the climatic conditions worldwide. The environment has been polluted with an increase of greenhouse gases. The major consequences are global warming, cyclone, an increase in sea level, etc. It has a clear negative impact on the natural environment including aquatic ones. As a result, production of fish in the aquaculture system and marine system is greatly affected. Marine ecosystems like coral reefs are also destroyed. Decreased fish production has also affected the livelihood and economic condition of the fish farmers. So, corrective measures should be taken to reduce the climate changes for minimizing its effects on fish production. Using more eco-friendly substances, planting more trees, and preserving our nature are some steps to be taken. Awareness should also be generated among the common people.</div></div>
